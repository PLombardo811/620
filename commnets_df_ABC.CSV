"At this point in any American's life, if you know anyone that still supports the biggest traitor to ever hold office in our country-Trump. 
One must evaluate one's own character on why they surround themselves with those that hate our country so much in these dire times and self-reflect on why they failed themselves in discerning those of lacking in dignity and character in their lives.

If you know people that would rather support a treasonous criminal than have support for our own people, country and our constitution, that speaks volumes about yourself. 

Proud of myself for not knowing one soul that would trade in patriotism for this treasonous conman.

"This is a Red Dawn for our country. You will wake up some morning with Russian tanks on your home town street. Russia has one thing on their mind - -  world domination."
"President Trump made it clear to Russia that America is his primary concern and that American workers can and will compete to win business contracts in Europe. President Trump made it clear to the world that he will not allow Russia to jeopardize American interest. Liberals want America to fail for purely political reasons. President Trump continues to WIN not for himself, but for those patriots, law abiding, and hard working Americans that voted for him. Those still against President Trump at this point are ignoring the tangible benefits of his Presidency and the rise in American power and influence around the world. Long live the President; long live President Trump."

We have FBI officials refusing to hand over subpoenaed documents!, answer questions, and even refusing to show up when subpoenaed!

"Appears that the Liberal Democrats are attempting to cash in on a post haste golden opportunity between two super powers to diminish a President’s constitutional authority to mediate peacekeeping for the benefit of the nation.

Instead of having the political lore to read between the proverbial political lines, the President’s notorious smear foes continually maintain their abhorrent public attacks on the nation’s Executive Office. Who really is the traitor in this infamous game of thrones? 

One must ask historically using unequivocal damning evidence that the Russian Government had indeed meddled in the 2016 General Election. Was reaffirming the obvious and forgone conclusive international infraction with a Russian President going to rewrite history and undo what the Liberal Democrats had already succeeded at? Was approaching Mr Putin with an offensive public retort for all the world to see going to eradicate the fact that the Obama Administration were deeply intertwined with the Russian Government by exposing secure government servers in the private sector for every international hacker to access? 

Let’s look at the key players involved in this insidious preemptive coup to publicly smear the nation’s 45th President. 

1) John McCain - RINO extraordinaire; still reeling from the President’s remarks on the legitimacy of his POW hero status. Current medical condition invalidates any validity to a logical and unbiased political argument.

2) John Brennan - Co-conspirator in the Hillary Clinton Uranium 1 sell out to the Russian Government. His untimely Tweet will certainly come back to haunt him when unmasking efforts due to a phony Dossier compounded with bastardizing a FISA court jurisprudence using fake espionage rationale to become a fly on the wall in Trump Tower will bring to light this whole phony collusion investigation by the Judicial Department.

3) Sen Jeff Flake - RINO extraordinaire; Obama Senate surrogate and a firm Democrat Senate vote despite public opinion, who is retiring and seeking a 2020 Presidential campaign. There’s no fuzz that his Senate voting record has been consistently filibustering with his Liberal Democrat underworld; the outspoken and obstructionist Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) will attest to that.

4) House Speaker Paul Ryan - RINO extraordinaire; Obama legacy underworld as evidenced by his private meeting with Obama immediately after the election, is a two faced pontificator depending on which way the Congressional wind blows at any given moment. Does Speaker Ryan know how to take a political stand against any issue and enforce his conviction? 

5) Senator Lindsay Graham - RINO extraordinaire; Obama legacy underworld who continually uses the media as his personal messenger with a smiling friendly face, stares with a tenuous conviction, then tries to convince the public about  opportunities which attenuates general consensus to his flavor of the day retort.

6) Eliot Engel (D-NY) - House  Foreign Affairs Committee - quote: 
“a disgrace...because of the President’s reckless and disgusting behavior, the entire week has been a disaster for American leadership and our standing in the world. What will it finally take for my Republican colleagues in Congress to stop covering for this President and stand up for our country?”

Can one say political over-reaction? Or perhaps Et Tu Brute may be more appropriate in this nonsensical case?

Opinion: the Liberal Democrats know they are losing ground in both Congressional Houses in this upcoming midterm elections. Since the President has been under investigation for possible collusion during the 2016 election, the Liberal Democrat Congressional hecklers were chomping at the bit to scurry their attacks on this President who had just won a moral war at a NATO Summit by asking each nation to pay their fair share. A successful United Kingdom <f0><U+009F><U+0087><U+00AC><f0><U+009F><U+0087><U+00A7> visit which saw Prime Minister Theresa May adjust her BREXIT disposition favorably toward EU dissolution.

As these political naysayers rear their ugly heads and maintain their dismay toward this President for all the world to see, one may ask: who really is the Traitor in this ongoing chess game which exposes the Liberal and RINO pawns as true American adversaries, who are out to undermine and discredit an American election result which saw 63M voters beckon for change in the American political arena? Do they realize that they are the reason this President is speaking to Vladimir Putin instead of Hillary Clinton? 

Today’s scathing and pontificating apostolates from these reckless and irresponsible disgraceful lawmakers, and moreover those treasonous guilty forces who attempted to sell out the country to these same Russian players during the previous Presidential Administration, prove beyond a shadow of a doubt the validity of this President’s occupancy in the Oval Office in 2018 and more than likely beyond 2020."
"Trump: ""Putin was very powerful in his denial."""
"We just found out today Hilary got 400 million dollars from Russia and the FBI is hiding it all and you are mad at Trump. Idiots. It was bad enough when we knew Hilary and Dems were the most crooked politicians in history now after today it's worse then we think. Yet, it's Trumps fault."

He answered that question with some questions Pissing everyone off! My thoughts are I have watched what has happened and been happening since his candidacy was announced! WE have seen what the DNC and the National Media has done along with the Top Floor of the FBI and the Justice Department all working together to keep The President from being Elected! My question is, DO WE TRUST THEM???
P.S. The Senate Oversight Committee is still trying to get Subpoenaed Documents from the FBI and the Justice Department with Both Branches thumbing their noses at the Federal Subpoena' and the Justice Department Deputy AG is under threat of impeachment for not turning them over and THEY STILL will not comply with The Senate Oversight Committee! Once again, DO WE TRUST THEM???"

"If you put all the pieces together here's what you get. The DNC rigs the Democratic Primary Election against Bernie Sanders so Hilliary can win the nomination. Obama's administration starts to request surveillance on Trump, his family, his transition team, and anyone associated with him. Donna Brazil gives Hilliary the questions to a debate. The DNC pays Christopher Steele to come up with a smear dossier about Trump. The mainstream media releases a taped conversation about Trump talking about grabbing women parts. After all this Trump still wins the General Election. Obama orders an investigation into Russia meddling in our elections. Obama changes Executive Order 12333 to allow more agencies to have access to surveillance data. The Democratic Party comes up with a scandal that Trump Colluded with Russia to win the election with no evidence or proof. This wild claim is backed up by the mainstream media. Obama hold overs start unmasking Trump's transition team and staff members then release the classified information to the mainstream media. Why? Because the DNC and the Obama administration colluded with the intelligence community to thwart Trump's campaign efforts to get him elected president. All this Russia collusion is an attempt to cover up the fact that the Obama administration, the intelligence community, the DNC, along with the mainstream media used our nations surveillance as a political tool to try to get Hilliary elected President. This makes Watergate look like a kindergarten play. Let that sink in......."
