(the crime of) showing no loyalty to your country, especially by helping its enemies or trying to defeat its government:

In 1606 Guy Fawkes was executed for treason."
We should have a revote..  We know they meddled and obviously there's treason here.
"Call the Judiciary Committee @ 202-225-3951. Leave a comment that details what you would like to see happen to Trump or what you want them to uphold. I requested impeachment.  This is the perfect time to get main stream republicans on board with America, not Trump."
"Wake up people, a president who puts down his own federal government, and backs and accredits a tyrant who seeks to undermine our democracy. How can we not see that our president is a Traitor!"
"US intelligence has shown themselves to be at best, corrupt and possibly behind the alleged collusion to begin with."
The President looked absolutely terrible today. In over his head when it comes to any diplomacy required for allies or enemies.
Trump stood there with his TAIL BETWEEN HIS LEGS !
"Such a traitor.  What does Putin know about him, that he is afraid our country is going to find out?  Watch out Trump, he now has his hand in your pocketbook"
Doesn’t this rather blatant deference to Putin make you wonder what the Russian said to our “president” in private? What did he threaten Trump with?
"I like trump, its time to tell the world how American establishment really used to operate  ""Lies"" blackmail, Saddam, blackmail Amin, blackmail Gaddafi, now trump says that must stop!!! He's with the people of the world."
"You know his supporters will not see it that way. They are like deer in the headlights, only they think the lights are there to light the way and will only realise the truth once the truck has run them over."
"Putie is saying that as a democracy, we should vote on whether Russia interfered with our election.  Well, I cast my vote that Russians definitely interfered with our election.  As a matter of fact, many fake FB posters are obviously Russians."
Where are all the Republicans the ones that even voted for him can they not see what is happening or are they that blind
The only thing proven is that Hillary's troop received money from Russia.  Lol. Tell the whole story CBS. More half truths and fake news.
"Maintain the lie. 
He has to maintain the lie. By discrediting the Secret Service findings against Russia(Putin). He discredits the findings against him. It's all under the same umbrella. 
It's treasonous"
"So hand over the 12 people and let democracy decide.  And KGB???   That's our respected competition?   That is cold war times-- on the side of the enemy.   So if you are siding with Putin, pick up a history book. This is all back talking-- dazzle them with brilliance or baffle them with B.S.   I say the second is the American Great Again mentality.  And it's not so great, Russia is not an equal or allie to the US, and this interview is a joke and this summit is pure profit and not about the American people."
LIKE  he is going  to  admit  it  shameful   for the so  call president of the US wao how could  he.<f0><U+009F><U+00A6><U+0082><f0><U+009F><U+0090><U+00BD>
"Hehehe, US just lost the world moral policing function, they should soul search first, real trying moments for them. Putin is smart in this game"
"and how many governments has the US interfered with, Korea, Vietnam, Haiti, Germany, Iraq, Afganistan , Syria and who know how many more."
"Exactly !! Where is the evidence ,??? We see how these people lie !! Put up or shut up !! 
Yes we are a democracy unless the democrats get ahold of America"
"VOTE like the future depends on it - - it does. The 2018 midterm elections will mostly be held on Tuesday, November 6, 2018."
"We interfere in everything, everywhere,everyone.  And then lie about it.  Putin says he didn't do it,,,He didn't do it."
"What a spineless twit! Sounds like he’s in front of his investors asking why their investment is 20 mill in the hole. And he answers with, don’t worry, I’m not going to pay the contractor"
"CBS you lie again President Trump denied nothing. He wants release of all information so a fully informed decision can be finalized. Our FBI is so full of deceitful, disloyal terrorist you can’t believe a word they say."
"Trump believes Putin, but doubts the FBI. I never thought I'd see anything like this. America is being sold down the river, and Trump supporters can't even see it. Trump loves blind loyalty."
If you want to see the server look into the mirror an you will see Putin's server!!! #treasonoustrump
PUTIN: Hillary Clinton Pocketed $400 Million Illegal Contribution in Tax-Free Russian Money During 2016 Election\
Putin looks really guilty at least nervous.
"Well, as long as both of them say it then it must be true.  Lmao"
"We can only look at the facts: The United States was attacked, and President Trump, today, publicly sided with the enemy.  And my opinion is he should now be considered a traitor and removed ASAP."
Lol Putin returned one of his balls back and he threw it to Melania <U+26BD>
You are watching a traitor and a dictator
"Traitor, embarrassing to our country."
"Lock him up for treason.  In fact, identify his base and lock them up too.  Maybe we should reassign ICE."

look who is wagging the dog!
Being stupefyingly  moronic is one thing...being stupefyingly moronic and borderline treasonous...now you’re in impeachment territory
"Did anyone really expect anything different? Both are liars, this is not surprising."
Proof trumps protecting Putin he trusts the KGB over America’s intelligence
"after looking closely , Sylvia Burwell was not hired because of political bias on the board and favoritism to a liberal.
she was hired because of her Endowment raising potential , money is the key to a university. I had to wonder why when she didn't have a masters degree and no educational experience.
I suspected she may have had some connection with the Russian Agent that graduated from American University but she took the position in 2017 so I looked at the board that seemed to be leaning far left . However I now see her position was offered for non political reasons

She had posts in the Clinton administration and was president of global development programs for the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and was president of the Walmart Foundation.
Russian agent arrested .

Trump did the right thing.they want war with Russia . That is the agenda.
Best buddies lying for each other.
Where is the server ? Show Trump the server ! Show the American people this server or at least the President so he can tell us.
Let’s hope he is smart enough to throw dat soccer ball da kgb commie dictator gave him in da trash...but he probably isn’t ...said he was gonna give it to his son
"der fuhrer tRUMPf is nothing more than an ignorant, treasonous coward"
"Whoever, owing allegiance to the United States, levies war against them or adheres to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort within the United States or elsewhere, is guilty of treason and shall suffer death, or shall be imprisoned not less than five years and fined under this title but not less than $10,000; and shall be incapable of holding any office under the United States."
"When announcing the indictment of 12 Russian intelligence officers the other day, Rod Rosenstein said, ""There is no allegation in this indictment that any American citizen committed a crime. There is no allegation that the conspiracy changed the vote count or affected any election result."" Obama's DHS Chieif Jeh Johnson said the same thing after the election. Also, if the DNC/Hillary campaign had not written emails about paying people to violently disrupt Trump rallies, and about Donna Brazile giving Hillary debate questions before the debate, and about rigging the primaries against Bernie, and about John Podesta being invited to Satanic ceremonies, a hack by anyone on earth would not have mattered because there wouldn't have been anything there to be found. Even now, no one is saying the emails were forged. So, if it was the Russians who hacked the DNC, they ""interfered"" by revealing the truth about what the Democrats were doing to the American people.
http://time.com/5338451/rod-rosenstein-russian-indictment-transcript/"
I can see it now. He will bring in Russian troops to kick down our doors and pry our guns from our cold dead fingers. Then detention centers with gas chambers and then finally microchipping everyone.
Its the truth....wasn't russia
Trump and Putin are going to work together on Cyber security. Sleep well.
Jonathan Lemire(reporter AP) deserves a medal. He threw a perfect pitch and tRUMP struck out.
"There was no Russian hacking nor is there a disinformation/propaganda whatever made up nonsense the war mongers in Washington are trying to convince you to be afraid of. IF Russia did hack into the DNC servers, in what the DNC calls 'the greatest attack on America since 9/11' the DNC would have allowed the FBI and DHS to inspect their servers. Both departments requested access to investigate, both were denied access. Instead this entire charade is based on a report by crowdstrike, a private firm who the DNC paid for the report. 

There is no tangible evidence that can be outside verified of this Russian hacking, just accusations. You say that 'well they got indictments, there must be evidence!' Well Concord consulting was one of the indicted companies earlier, and they showed up to defend themselves in court. Guess what Mueller did? Stonewalled discovery, refused to hand over evidence the defense is legally entitled to review, and got an order blocking the release of evidence. How's that for having all this evidence?

The defense apparatus in the United States is a trillion dollar a year business. The existence of NATO is completely dependent on there being a threat from Russia. If you don't think there's an incredibly powerful beaurocracy in Washington hellbent on preventing trump from normalizing relations with Russia, you're kidding yourself. You can repeat MSM talking points about how 'an evil dictator hacked our democracy' and is waging a 'disinformation war on the United States' but you're just repeating propaganda and not presenting any facts what so ever."

Peas in a pod so why would or should we believe either one.
If the answer can only come via a trial then why won’t Putin turn over the people who were indicted?
This is ridiculous. He is a traitor to the country!
"Did not want to upset his boss, might loose his bonus."
Shouldn't the podium say He'llsinkus 2018?
Trump's denial goes beyond unbelievable.

2) Who gives a fk about the server? The FBI proved it happened. So what that they didn't confiscate it...they took the data from it.
3) How can he believe Putin over OUR government agencies???

"There are 3 distinct issues. 1 - Trump did not collude with Russia to become president, there's no evidence at all. 2 - Russia has been meddling in free elections around the world since Krushchev and did so in 2016 in many countries not the US. 3 - Russia's stated goal has been to use the Western media to undermine democracy, which is what they are gong to us. They little lie they plant is picked up by the media and mobilize hatred and protests. Russia has even organized the protests that the liberals show up at."
"But Mr. Putin , Trump has already cried foul with the judges in the courts ever since he was elected . Now maybe he has enough republican judges on the supreme court to let him off the hook ."
What kind of interference? Did Russia enable Trump to win? Did they something to the voting machines? No is explaining just exactly what Russia did.
There was more interference with our election by the illegal Democrat run sanctuary cities.

"He just openly opposed the FBI, CIA and  every intelligence agency report that verifies the collusion! This should be more than enough to impeachhim! He is openly violating his oath of office to uphold the Constitution!!!! If THIS isn't treason, what IS??? The GOP would have supported Benedict Arnold judging from their response here. Putin is being supported over his own country?????"

"Russian meddling had zero impact on the 2016 election. And Trump had nothing to do with any of it. Yet, Dems  are  peeing all over themselves trying to nail Trump for it 24/7 for 18 months."
Holy hell! This ass believes Putin that Russia had nothing to do with anything? He needs to be gone! Even members of his own party are against him on this! And instead he is worrying about emails... where are your tax returns assclown?!!!?!?
I am so proud of my vote for President Trump. He asks the questions that the corrupt media will not.
Did you ever see a weaker American President in your life. How much longer is Trump going to try to use the Hillary Clinton get out of jail card. I will tell you Hillary would have had the balls to tell Putin eat shit
"GOP 
Be ashamed
Be very ashamed."
"Ok people it's that time again , trampanzee bingo . Who had Hillary/Obama and or uranium/iran with FBI/Fake news??"
"I refuse to believe 0bama’s lying FBI gestapo jackbooted thugs working with Mueller that there was Russian involvement in the election.
The only Russian involvement was in HillaryClinton’s Uranium undercover deal for her OWN PROFIT!"
"Obama's DHS Chief, Jeh Johnson: ""I think it's important to note that on election night we had our guard up ... on election night we did not see anything that amounted to altering ballot counts or degrading the abilty to report election results, nothing out of the ordinary ... We see no evidence that hacking by any actor altered the ballot count or any cyber actions that deprived people of voting"" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNe9o6hGKEw"
"Trump could not answer a simple question on any given day. Putin is president in name only, he is a dictator! They both lie, the only difference is trump admits he lies."
Why would anyone believe the FBI CIA. or DOJ after all the shit that has come out of it. Plus How did they from 12 Russians names on a server they never got all the DNC server went to a 3rd party and they reported back to the FBI. So any info they got about russia came from a 3rd party.
"not a single vote was changed, not a single ballot box hacked. America voted and you just cannot accept that Trump beat a Clinton."
CBS really?  I didnt here Trump deny anything.  FAKE NEWS
"I don't know how ANY  American can NOT be ashamed of what happened today.  We all thought 9-1-1 was bad, just wait
When you don't listen to the people around you we are in BIG trouble.  
We have no allies anymore and now he is kisses Puttin's butt.  Scares the hell out of me"
"Whatever Trump does makes the press angry; they potray his statements to EU and his dealing with Putin unbecoming of an American prresident. Whatever he says is wrong! I believe he put the Europeans at their place- down. Russinas are our adversaries, so are the EU brothers (sisters too!)."
"Mr. President no matter what you say the maine Stream Media will twist it the way they  want so why tell them a dam thing . we Trust you and we feel your doing the best you can with so many in Politics and politicians  working to ditroy you . why give them the time of day BS . You work for Us same as the Corrupt Politicians should be,. so let the media go back to bed ."
"This deflection will work for people that support him/never hillary crowd. His entire reason for not ""locking her up"" was to use the attempt to pursue it later as a carrot.

People eat this stuff up like rabid dogs"
Trump did the right thing Delma really you are so blind and deaf. He went there to get more money and tell Putin  secret information    If he wanted peace why did he had to be with him over two hours by themselves really    You’re so freaking dumb
"People are finally starting to think on thier own, using their brains and questioning what is fed to us down the tv and smart phones, fake news is everywhere someone will always profit from it."
"So in trumps world there are only two that are ever telling the truth, him and putin! In the real world a great majority of folks know that the two of them are the biggest liars walking!"
Please impeach Trump!!! Our nation is in the hands of an enemy of the state. Trump has demonstrated today to be enemy of the Unites States.
Lol hillary was going to kick ass and forget taking names of course putin wanted trump clintons are ruthless and they can balance a check book hell ill take trump over war
Trump looks like the chicken from Moana...Hei Hei! What a coincidence Hei Hei means 'disturbance' or an 'interruption from the norm'!!!
"Trump:  A complete, utter buffoon.  Derides and ridicules our allies while defending dictators.  He's a traitor to the US."
Standing up for our most dangerous enemy.  So much for the oath of office Trump took to defend us from all enemies foreign and domestic.
This idiot just flushed America down the toilet. How do we get this Russian sympathizing Commie out of office?
"Trump has been called many names, F-ing Moron, sexual predator, malignant narcissist, now we can add Traitor !"
"We must call Congress: 202-224-3121 and remind them that they work for ""we the people"", therefore, impeachment proceedings must begin immediately. We can no longer afford to be complicit or complacent. Our democracy is depending on all of us to speak up and speak out."
Trump said the right thing.  Lets keep peace.  Not war.
"Who gives a shit, we have been meddling in other country politics for years! Just ask Obama about Israel"
Treason i cant belive you own president prefer to defend Putin intead of defending their ouwn wooo sooo sad
Lol u mean like how Hillary said 17 Intelligence agencies said without a doubt that Russia involved in the election but the funny part that there isn't 17 Intelligence Agencies lol
"We have punk US reporters asking punk questions to the President's of the United States and President of Russia!!!! These people would get their asses kicked years ago for this disrespect!! You won't see any Russian reporters disrespecting Putin, or they'd end up in a Gulag or Dead, or both!!!"
Democrats paying protester is being overlooked
and our GOP congress says nothing about demanding a resignation or face impeachment??? Lock them all up!
"Russia didn't hack shit. This is fake news.
The ""ebil Russian haxor"" was actually Seth Rich. And he was a patriot."
there going to hell when they die
"American journalism, that is the real embarrassment to USA.  Stupid biased questions, meanwhile real world events are going on where people are dying every day, but they ask stupid questions which they know the answer will be."
The truth hurts
If you’re a Trump supporter and your father or grandfather fought for our country in WWll you should be ashamed of yourself!
"Will the domestic enemies of the ratified constitution actually be allowed to overthrow the American Republic, and strip our posterity of having the legal say of constitutional conventions protect their liberties and grant the only powers to government?"
"Leftist National News is bizarre, shameful and mispresentation of the truth."
"“Putin denies having any knowledge so shaming him won’t accomplish anything”

Like if you agree this piece of shit should be hung!"
"What kind of President condemns the press, the courts and the FBI while defending Russia and Putin?"
"trai·tor
['trad<U+0259>r]
NOUN
a person who betrays a friend, country, principle, etc.."
of course putin would deny it. trump even encouraged russians to do hacking.
Because that collusion is just Liberal left imaginary things ! it is impossible to show any single evidence !!! Even Mueller failed so many times because threre is NO collusion !
You morons are delirious. Your opinions are as worthless as CNN fake blithering.
Turn the server over it's that easy...they can show RUSSIA hacked or didn't
TRAITOR!!!
"US Intelligence agencies have no credibility since they couldn't stop 9/11, cannot stop school shootings even though they were warned about people that ended up committing violent acts against citizens, and they couldn't stop someone from hacking a DNC computer or creating face social media accounts trying to supposedly with the election for Trump. Still not sure how Russia was able to get Trump to win even though you cannot hack voting machines."
"Trump is the laughingstock of the world what a asshole,  Mr bitch no balls kissing Putin's ass ."
"The President didn’t deny they hacked us, he denied there was collusion from him."
"""There was no collusion"" is Trump's favorite expression. Yet members of his campaign staff were found guilty, pled guilty and were sentenced and arrested. Why did Trump publicly ask for Russia's help in meddling with the DNC and Hilary's servers in front of news reporters and the whole world during the elections? Trump loves having others take the fall for him. Do you really believe the lame excuse that he didn't know what his own staff or even his own son and daughter were doing? Employers are held responsible and cannot claim ignorance as an excuse to allow their employees to conduct illegal actions. Why? Because it is their responsibility to know. Why should Trump not be held to the same legal standards as everyone else? Presidents are not above the law."
Our country is corrupt.  Because of the Democratic party the FBI.  And our intelligence. They all protecting something. Mmmm wonder what it is.
"Trump, just go live with your daddy Putin.  Trump the Traitor.  Traitor Trump.... hum...."
RUSSIA is not a Democracy lol only Putin belive that
NO Mr. Putin WE ARE A REPUBLIC NOT A FUCKING DEMOCRACY its a huge difference  +
Democrats will ways believe the Russia Russia Russia. Because Hillary lost a fixed election.
It was not the Russians who infiltrated the computers of the DNC or Hillary's computer. It was SETH RICH who did it with the help of Wikileaks. Someone killed SETH RICH to prevent us from realizing the dirtiness of the Democrats.
"TRUMP: Mr Putin sir, did you have anything to do with Russian meddling in the United States election?
PUTIN: (stands up) and says NO, now drop to your knees...
TRUMP:  *sucking sounds*"
"He threw his country under the bus today. He did it so BADLY, his own appointed Director of National Intelligence spoke out against him."
"This is dangerous day for America.  This president is not only a moron, he is treasonous.  He needs to be locked up. This is not about party anymore -- this is about the fate of our country.  What is left of the GOP should be railing against the actions of this baby king.  John Kasich seems to be the only ""R"" who has the balls to speak out.beside a few others like Jeff Flake who is not running for re-election. We should all be deeply disturbed by 45's actions today and over the past week."
"<U+202A>Do you know, that MR. Trump did not speak or even mention about September-11 tragedy .. !! <U+202C>
The truth is that there’s no such thing as Muslim Hijackers .
The planes that hit the International Trade Towers and the pentagon were remotely controlled by satellites ."
We know we have an enemy from within and sadly it's the president .
Trump should be impeached and arrested for committing treason
Trump cult member here. I can learn Rushian because I already no American reel good.
"Defends the KBG, while throwing America under the bus.
Piece
Of
Shit"
"Two fucking putrid sub-human who delight in fucking over people, and especially our country."
IMPEACH ASSHAT tRump NOW!
So the Clintons sold 145 mil worth of uranium to putin   The dems don’t want voter id so the illegals can vote <f0><U+009F><U+00A4><U+0094>
Hahahahaha TRUMP dont have the balls to tell his boos anything
Trump minions just got raped.
We are not a democratic state. We are a federation of states. One that the asshole in orange has to answer to.
"If he isn't impeached over his treason many people could possibly end up demonstrating and protesting as they did during Vietnam. 

Civil unrest only because Trump is more concerned about his ego and his manufactured reputation as a deal maker than he is being the President of the United States.

He and his rich lapdog crusaders have robbed American's of the American dream for anyone who is a working class or impoverished citizen.

Kill vocational schools, rob public schools of funding giving it to charter schools, get rid of apprenticeships and Unions and that will be Trump's great American, great for the privileged but a fucking dystopian nightmare for everyone else.

And you're doing it to yourself. You make 20,000-60,000 a year an vote Republican simply and only because you think you're rich and powerful,  living in your delusions while dragging down all of America with you in your inanity, your pursuit of wealth. They use your needs and gluttony against you to their own ends."
CBS is going bat shit crazy other this and the six people watching their news  are too !
They have one of the Awan brothers laptop what about that computer. <f0><U+009F><U+00A4><U+0094>
"CBS .... STHU,  Your a hysterical moron."
More incoherent ramblings from the dotard.
"why would Trump trust the FBI, CIA, or DOJ.  They have been against him for the start."
Oh the Media is gonna go Wild with this .
I live in Europe which now is a hostile part of the world towards USA according to Trump. The fact is that majority of the ppl who voted for Trump doesn’t know where Russia is or who Putin is and i only blame the Fox News for that.
Dumbass traitor.....no surprise....he does like fuckin with Russians....

Trump is trolling you guys and its hialrious. You liberals are having a shit fit.
"Trump did a great job.
Treason is selling Putin our uranium.
Treason is purchasing a fraudulent Dossier which was connected to the Kremlin.
Treason is giving billions of dollars to Iran.
Meeting with Putin to try and make the world a better place is NOT treason, it’s leadership.
Treason is Mueller (dirtbag) finding any reason to detract from anything good my President is doing by continuing a bogus investigation, when in fact Mueller is guilty of covering up for Clinton. 
Sessions: Do your damn job and fire that dirtbag and end this joke of an investigation."
"Seems to me the FBI lets the dems keep a lot of so called evidence.. The servers, Hillary and aides all get to keep their laptops  etc. and able to destroy them.. and poor Seth Rich dead cause he leaked it.. I mean come on a robbery In the middle of the night and decided to kill him.."
"COLLUSION DOJ Bruce Ohr husband of Nellie Ohr at FUSION GPS paid for fake dossier. WHICH IS A CRIME TREASON TO FIX ELECTION AND CARRIES THE DEATH PENALTY. Fusion GPS was a very small and secretive company that, according to the Washington Post profile today, never had more than ten employees. Her background is intriguing: A review of open source materials shows Mrs. Ohr was described as a Russia expert at the Wilson Center, a Washington think tank, when she worked there, briefly, a decade ago. The Center’s website said her project focused on the experiences of Russian farmers during Stalin’s collectivization program and following the invasion of Russia by Nazi forces in 1941. She has also reviewed a number of books about twentieth century Russia, including Reconstructing the State: Personal Networks and Elite Identity in Soviet Russia (2000), by Gerald Easter, a political scientist at Boston College, and Bertrand M.

Hitler tore up the Treaty of Versailles and told his people that this is going to free them from "" international meddling""...aka. Globalization... and make their country great again. And what does Donald Trump do? He tears up all of our treaties currently and bashes NATO what's the difference?. Hitler tells his people he's building up the military for ""peace"" what is Donald Trump doing building up the military and what does he say it's for ""peace ""

The parallels to Hitler and how he got where he did so fast or frightening.
