I totally agree with you Anderson this President MUST GO! A total disgrace! Anyone with a brain knew that when he was elected! A sad day for American Democracy!
"Russian mafia at its best!!  Congrats Republicans we are now hostages to Putin, including your president!!!!!!"
"Donald Trump looked at the cameras and specifically asked Russia to obtain his opponents' emails. Russia did exactly as Trump requeted. That is collusion.

Then today, Trump threw American intelligence agencies under the bus and deferred to the foreign head of state responsible for responding to Trump's request to hack emails. That is treason."
"If any true American Patriots exist in the Republican Party - now is the time to indict, impeach and incarcerate!"
"Thank you Anderson, you‚Äôre absolutely correct!  But yet his base is applauding it and the congress is mute"
When the President of the United States doesn't side with The United States.. something is definitely wrong with this pictureÌ†æÌ¥î
"Treason .
Whoever, owing allegiance to the United States, levies war against them or adheres to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort within the United States or elsewhere, is guilty of treason and shall suffer death, or shall be imprisoned not less than five years and fined under this title but not less than $10,000; and shall be incapable of holding any office under the United States.

Trump orders the American citizens to denounce our intelligence agencies and the free press. Trump orders the American citizens to embrace Putin and to fully trust this dictator who has starved and murdered his own people. Trump will soon follow Putin's blueprint as to how to rule a country.
"Sad that our President chose to insult 850,000 intelligence personnel in our nation, so he could please Putin.

Trump has met the Russian objectives so far in our nation:
1) Make our NATO allies our enemies
2) De legitimize our security forces, FBI, CIA, NSA, ETC
3) De legitimize our free press
4) De legitimize our court systems
5) De legitimize people seeking asylum
6) De legitimize our election system"
Hey tRumpsters what happened to make America Great again??? Trump just sided with Russia over the USA Ì†ºÌ∑∫Ì†ºÌ∑∏ and our intelligence n law enforcement
I don't think I have ever watched something more chickenshit than Trump rolling over for Putin and betraying his own country. This is the best leadership the US can offer up?????
"When are Americans going to demand this man out of office, he is committing treason and we as Americans are letting him do this, surely this has to wobble the base a little, since when has America ever done any of the things to Russia, we can't feel sorry for them and if Trump shame us as a nation he needs to be out of office"
"I am thoroughly embarrassed that our country that was once great is now a laughing stock. All these people that continue to support Trump after the mockery of a press conference should he ashamed. Only a clueless person would support him. I could have sworn this was a democracy but clearly the fact that people are okay with a president bowing down to Russia means the state of America is at its  weakest point. Still bringing up Hillary after facts continue to point to Russia interference in our election.  I guess these sad people will still support him through impeachment.  Wake up people, everyone can finally see how this coubtry has been set back many years. Great job Republicans"
"Putins puppet, a mole in our beautiful white house. A disgrace to our country. The most unpatriotic lying, maniac, narrcisstes sociopath, human being trying to lead our country right to hell"
"Thank you Anderson Cooper!! Benedict Donald is killing our country and our rights are slowly being taken away. 
This con artist Devil Russian puppet is so unstable it's scary!"
Let's pass legislation for phychiatric & IQ evaluation for future candidates for president. Because ladies and gents we have a bonified moron for a president. Embarrassing & pathetic.
"He has got to go.  We can not allow a traitor in our White House. Republican Senators better get some kuhunas and defend our country, democracy, the voters, and our intelligence community.   Pick a side. Party or country? Russia or the U.S.?"
"WOW... did everyone see it today? The most powerful man in the world... the leader of the United States of America on the same stage, standing right next to Donald Trump... did you see it?"
"I don't believe anything the President says anymore, he's been caught in so many open lies. And before you start spewing your hate let me say this. I believe in Republican values, religious freedom, gun ownership, and I'm  fiscally conservative. But this administration is something different, I fear for the future of this country."
"All the conservatives who love Trump ... historically your hero has been Reagan, who would be APPALLED at this treason. What are you thinking??"
It‚Äôs clear that Trump is in bed with Putin.  He must be impeached.  He agreed Putin didn‚Äôt interfere and all intelligence says the Russians did.  Now who do you believe.  An act of treason needs to be handled as impeachable.
Putin the real president of the United States bend trump over in front rmt of millions!!!.. I hope all the uneducated trump supporters are happy now!!...and they should bend over for their true president putin!!!
"Treasonous, traitor, anyone else would have been impeached.  Are there any American patriots left in office??  Yes, I know, I hear the crickets too.....Ì†æÌ¥¢"
Shame on you Anderson you warmonger.  You  and the far left are trying to start a war with Russia u blood thirsty SOBs
"Sadly, he doesn't care..his supporters don't care and the Republican Party could care less, since they are all making money on this and they are all the future holders of the new Republican Oligarchy ."
We are on a collision path with Trump!! Feel sorry for his performance today! He is up to something!!! Congress needs to step up and earn their pay!  Shameful what he's getting away with.
LOCK HIM UP !!! TREASON !!!  He better NEVER put his hand over his heart and pledge allegiance to the UNITED STATES AGAIN !!  I cannot believe that he isn't being handcuffed as we speak !!
He proved today he has no business being the President of the United States!!! Down right disgusting!!!
"How much of the USA do we have to lose before people, press, and Congress will stand up to this Communist Trump? Do we wait until we have no allies but Russia or do we stop it now as Americans that love our country?"
"You Americans might not believe in God or in prayers but at this rate after watching the Donald Trump speak, you guys need either an impeachment or an EXORCIST . Because even Idi Amin,won't go that low,insulting other President's achievements in such shameful manner on international stage."
"A Manchurian candidate is a person, especially a politician, being used as a puppet by an enemy power. The term is commonly used to indicate disloyalty or corruption, whether intentional or unintentional."
"Thank you Anderson. It is astounding that this guy can't act on our country's behalf. If this is not treason, then it is close. Where is our Representative? This is impeachable. Get him out before he sells us all to Russia. He should go to prison."
"True! any one that is paying attention to whats happening in our country and where this men wants to take us know it was a disgrace a embarrassment    And a troubling moment for the country...
and to say that Russia intelligence should work together with our intelligence is the one of the most absurd things this men ever saidÌ†ΩÌ∏°Ì†ΩÌ∏°Ì†ΩÌ∏°
Time to wake up!
We are being attack from within....Ì†ΩÌ∏°Ì†ΩÌ∏°Ì†ΩÌ∏°Ì†ΩÌ∏°"
"I watched the press conference live and as soon as it was over I was thinking the exact same thing. It was the most disgraceful performance by an American President. This is a sad day in American history. The press conference was horrifying to watch. President Trump said he believes Putin, an ex KGB agent and tyrant, over his own Department of Justice, some of the finest investigators and dedicated American law enforcement officers. President Trump threw America, democracy and the free press under the bus."
"This president in name only is a disgrace to our country,  and a real threat to our democracy.  I wonder if Putin offered him asylum for treason.   I hope so.   I would help him pack."
"I know this will probably get lost in the comments below, but sometimes when I‚Äôm home alone I like to go out in my garden and cover myself with dirt and pretend I‚Äôm a carrot."
"Here come the ""What about Obama?"" folks. Anytime Trump does something dumb, which is daily, his supporters' only defense is ""What about Obama?"" Dont believe me? Keep scrolling and reading the comments."
"This FBI agent Peter Strzok, a vet, is the true patriot and puts country first, I thank him for his service to our country, and hope his Dept helps in their investigations in erasing from our house traitor bone spurs and all his Russian mobsters! Thank you!"
"45 lacks integrity and his own GOP refuses to call him out on what just occurred with Putin... well can the Americans say now they want this 45 who lies in bed with Russia, a communist KGP leader... if u don‚Äôt wake up soon America u will be part of this cold Siberian country and ur allies that u have left will turn their backs.... and if this occurs u may even become a military country .... possible another World War , two countries against the world?"
Time for Congressional Republicans and anyone working in this administration to decide whose side they're on: America's or Trump's.
"Putin so bold suggesting our Intelligence and FBI come to Russia for joint investigation. Now we ALL know Trumpster is a Moran but the majority of Americans are not. Show Russian our investigative technology and other confidential information that they can use in the future. Putin, Trumpster and his Deplorables are the only ones you are Conning"
"‚ÄúJohn O. Brennan
John O. Brennan
@JohnBrennan
Donald Trump‚Äôs press conference performance in Helsinki rises to & exceeds the threshold of ‚Äúhigh crimes & misdemeanors.‚Äù It was nothing short of treasonous. Not only were Trump‚Äôs comments imbecilic, he is wholly in the pocket of Putin. Republican Patriots: Where are you???‚Äù"
Well he admitted Russia interfered with the election.  He got Putin to agree to allow Mueller to interview the 12 indicted.  Now Mueller needs to prove his evidence to get them extradited.  Surely better than a ‚Äúcut it out‚Äù verbal warning!
Avoid replying to obvious bots & trolls (may be a few actual idiots & Nazis in the mix). They write posts in support of Rump that are meant to generate a lot of responses which boosts their thread to the top where it gets read most often. Just make your own comment instead. Please spread the word. They are easy to spot because they puppet the same old BS.
It wouldn't matter if Pres Trump and Putin solved all the problems in one day.....regardless CNN and Anderson Pooper would find a way to spin it negatively...that is what CNN does and their hosts must follow suit or be unemployed.   Mindless journalistic garbage is what we've come to expect from CNN.
Putin owns Trump and how long will the GOP let this go on with Trump destroying our democracy. Does the GOP care about America or are they in the same camp with Putin and Russia.
"Disgraceful!!! I wonder what kind of dirt Putin has on Trump. Trump has no problem in throwing one of our allies under the bus, Germany, yet he can‚Äôt admit what his own party and cabinet had concluded that Russia did meddle in our election. It‚Äôs crazy.  The only explanation is that Russia has something very very troubling on him."
"Trump has his own State Run News Media. It is called Fox News. First step away from democracy!
Your president just threw you under the bus and his supporters love it! What happened to America first?"
We are in Bizarro world. Republicans know he's wrong but they are afraid to admit when it comes to Russia
"I agree with you....this is unreal! If he says Russia was involved, it would mean he did not win legally ...He is not giving this up.....He is owned by the Russians. Americans are losing their Democracy....watching it happen before our eyes and ears."
45 always backs up our enemies and not his own country. The only alliance 45 has are with our enemies. He does not belong as president because he is a traitor. His words and actions prove it daily.
"‚ÄúEveryone who works for President Trump: Quit now. Save your souls. Save your honor, such as it is. Save your reputation, such as it remains. Russia attacked our democracy. Trump has demonstrated repeatedly, and did so again with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Helsinki, that he doesn‚Äôt care and won‚Äôt...‚Äù -Columnist Ruth Marcus, The Washington Post"
Well the whole world saw 45 for what he really is. I am ashamed to say that he is POTUS. He‚Äôs not my president!  I never voted for him I saw him for what he was years ago. Leopards don‚Äôt change their spots.
"it was a fiasco, Trump chosing to believe Putin over his own US personnel who are here to serve him and the American People."
"It smells like treason. It looks treason. And, it sure as hell sounds like treason. This is what dishonorable looks like. It really quite simple at this point: If anybody still supports this clown, then you support treason and are a traitor to America."
"How we react and what Anderson Cooper says are so insignificant to what experienced US intelligence and defense officials are saying.  They are horrified, although not necessarily surprised.  That's scary for me."
"""President Putin was extremely strong and powerful in his denial today"" says Trump... Two malignant narcissists standing on a stage together embodying the very definition of denial: A defense mechanism in which confrontation with a personal problem or with reality is avoided by denying the existence of the problem or reality."
"Sounds to me that Puten has managed with his great evil, just like Hitler to mass mesmerize. Trump doesn't s try and a chance against someone that powerful to manipulate others thinking. Remember Rasputin mesmerized many in Russia especially the monarchy. 
Trump is basically a weak minded bully and is the easiest target for Putin."
"What a disgrace & an embarrassment to this country.  Sad,  Sad day for this country & the world for the US president to act & speak this way!   
This country is in a world of hurt & the Republican party needs to stand up & take action NOW!   It will only get worse!"
"I don't think anyone should be surprised by this.  

As for his base, I think if he were literallty sitting in Putin's lap whispering sweet nothings, they'd declare him the best foreign relations President of all time."
Is there anyone out there who Now does not think that Donald Trump is unfit for the office of the United States president
"So Trump believes a former KGB agent who knows how to play people.
He has sham elections and prisons those who run against him on bogus charges.
He has people poisoned one with dual citizenship twice. Has people shot on the streets and killed.
Goes into countries to assist in murdering citizens including children.
This President believes this man over his own Intelligence agencies in this country. Who are Republicans.
The Intel during the Obama administration said it was Russia and now this intel said the same.
Also other Allies sent the US intel about their hearing Russian chatter and were concerned.
So you have to wonder who this Administration and Republicans in Congress are loyal to.
The President always said it could have been a 400 pound guy in a basement.
Putin is not to be trusted.
This is beyond Clinton emails.
This is about the security of this country.
There have been multiple shows on TV that talk about how and what Putin authorizes.
Cspan where Intel testifies.
Folks really need to get past watching only Fox Entertainment channel.
I‚Äôm deeply concerned about the security of this country.
We need to rally voters in November.
This President does nothing but lie and profit off his Presidency."
"Anderson Cooper 360, next time dont say anything...silence says more mate.
Unbelievable, unsustainable, unfaithful towards Americans and allies! God help you all in 2020"
One of the lowest moment of the POTUS office emerged today. Shame on that so called ‚ÄúPresident‚Äù. 2020 can‚Äôt come soon enough. You bring dishonor to us all.
"Were y‚Äôall expecting anything different from him?  He will never own he was helped, his pride won‚Äôt allow it.  Everything is a game to him and he choose according.  After all, surely y‚Äôall didn‚Äôt think he was going to call Putin out to his face.  He‚Äôs a Twitter Bully, he‚Äôs too weak to say it to someone faceÌ†ΩÌ≤Ø.  What were y‚Äôall expecting?  Knowing is half the battle!"
"Who would ever have thought that we'd come to a time when the President of The United States speaks better of Russia than of the USA? If Obama had done that the GOP would have lynched him. Make NO Mistake we are on the path for BIG changes to our country, none of it good."
"It's very clear that there's more to this that will be coming out. I have a feeling that it was no coincidence that Rosenstein came out with the report of 12 Russian conspirators just days before the Trump-Putin meeting. Also, Lisa Page is probably giving incriminating evidence on Strzok, Comey, Mueller, Hilary and Obama that will make all this look very different."
I watched the press conference held in Helsinki on television today and what stunned me was that Putin wanted Trump to win. and what was equally surprising Trump did not win by the popular vote but won electorate vote in the US. Then don't forget during Trump's campaign prior to the US Presidential election he encouraged [told] Russia they could hack into Hilary Clinton's email. So what do call that sort of political conduct? Treason.
"I have been following this for awhile. I have worked on this piece by piece. The evidence us clearly in front of us. Why have our republicans not stepped up? This is clearly treason. Anderson, I worry about the state of our country at this point. What went on behind closed doors? I have to believe it strongly points to Putin having something in this so called President."
What a joke! These two promised each other something... slimes both of them... Trump loves Russia more than the USÌ†ΩÌπÑ
Secret Service is going to have to drag the wannabe dictator Putin puppet out of the white House when he gets impeached or loses the 2020 election
Donald Trump does not have a country. His Trump brand is his country. We are now Russian. We should change our flag and throw away our Constitution. I hope the Trump voters are ready and happy.  God Bless the real America.
"Glen Paul , All of our intelligence agencies say that Russia tampered with the election  and you just don‚Äôt believe it ? Somehow you think CNN is making up this proof for our intelligence agencies to make fake news? So curious to hear how you could possibly spin this to continue your adoration for Trump. Please educate me."
"And yet against n he is not afraid about his own people and to protect them from the thread we have , he is afraid just for himself that russia could release any vidion of him ( you know what is talking about) , and today was his opportunity for him to show us that  we can support him but if he support us , and again this opportunity was again for putin and  I was really really disappointed because I just started to support him and I expected from him to tell putin , that you did this and you have to pay consequences for that , but I was wrong again and , until the pee pee tape is in the middle we cannot have the support of our president he just will continue to attack us and praise his body body putin , full stop, and to be clear , the really thread we are facing is not putin , is our president and his enablers including his supporters and fox fake news , period"
"It was disgraceful. Not sure what to make of this.  It seems staged for us and the insult continues to be the idiotic digs at the Democrats and making false accusations that nothing was done back when. And this buddy cuddle with Putin?
But if we can get Russia to start getting along with others? That would be a miracle. Especially from someone not playing well with the rest of the World.  Head shaking.....Ì†ΩÌπèÌ†ºÌøº"
"I suggest that anyone who fully supports what he did today should just move to Russia.  You don't trust your own national security officers, so just leave.  Go someplace where you will feel at home as you clearly don't honor your country any longer."
"Traitor:typically as a slur against political dissidents, or against officials in power who are perceived as failing to act in the best interest of their constituents"
This is a sad day for America. This is not about Hillary or Obama. Were any charges bought against their administration? No. Trump's administration? Yes some indictments and guilties. Now stay focused. To ALL Trump supporters. He won. He's POTUS. Today our POTUS gave the key to the world to PUTIN. Just let that marinade. #wheresamerica
"Remember when they cried about how Obama didn't stand up to Russia? And Putin?

Now Trump is actually not standing up to him lmao and they're chill with that?

Funny how the rules change so quickly and how they forget so quickly.

Trump shat on Germany calling them a slave to Russia...then he went TO Russia and spoke with Putin. Siding with Putin. 

He brushed off the aggression towards other countries. Brushes off the murder of journalists and political opponents."
Didn't think he could go any lower but trump proved me wrong. He is a disgrace to America. The whole world was watching today and he supported Putin over our dedicated National security agencies. He will never admit the Russians aided him in his white house win whether or not he was involved. But that too we will find out soon.
When did America start liking Russia? After trump and republicans said it was ok. Right now Democrats looking more American than republicans.
"Ok, and why should we pay any attention to Anderson Cooper¬¥s opinions given his level of credibility as one of the major ambassadors of Fake News Media? I am not a Trump fan, but the way CNN and especially Mr. Cooper have become a totally biased 
Fake News machinery is repulsive to put it in nice words."
It all started when intelligence agencies all over Europe seeing people in Trump‚Äôs campaign meeting with Russians!!!!  Marco Rubio ordered the opposition research when he ran against Trump in the primaries. He was done with it so the Democratic Party picked it up!!!!  Obama was shocked by the whole thing!!!!!!
"No matter what they see with their own eyes or hear with their ears, Trumpsters will defend him, blame Obama and call it ""fake news""!  Both parties need to be held accountable for their corrupt ways but I don't want to be part of the United States of Russia!  Better look where the money's going folks cause I'm not seeing it trickle down to the people who need it!!!"
"Anyone who after this display of treason against our constitution and US laws. Still backs Trump, need to do one of two things
1: Seek Medical Help ASAP
2: Pack their bags they‚Äôre moving to Russia!"
"This was so pathetic that even Putin tried to help Trump. Putin stated that Trump‚Äôs position on the Ukraine was that it was an illegal action....almost as if Trump May forget and state the opposite.  Then the unbelievable lie that Putin did not know Trump was in Moscow for The Miss Universe pageant! The Miss Universe pageant, an international event bringing in millions of dollars into the economy and he did not realize the owner of it was in town? I think he just threw it in there because he realized he could say anything and Trump would agree."
"So sick of ""press"" opinions. Let the Americans just watch and determine. This is neither a Trump endorsement or criticism. I am just so very sick of your opinions, and that includes liberal and conservative news reporting."
"I think you need to get off his case about this Russian interference with the US elections.  Of all people, you should know that US and  Russia interfere with many countries' elections and will continue to do so as long as they remain the most powerful countries in the world. The fact  is that even though  the Russia tried to influence the election, the American people chose their leader, who just happened to be Trump. So accept him and support him as a president, while he is a president."
Why the big surprise here? Trump was in bed with the Russians long before the election.  The Trump family/ administration is only looking to benefit themselves.
"What an embarrassment.  The POTUS turns his back on his own people to side with Russia.  He is doing America zero good by going against our own intelligence team and their investigation.  Chomp knows that Russia interfered, he himself or his team worked this out with them.  He loves to reflect everything bad on anyone else. To date, it's always someone else doing wrong and he knows nothing about it.  It's Crap!  We must stand together and end his presidency ASAP!"
"It's official, the news is out. When the Americans TV series ended we were left wondering what happened to Phillip Jennings. We now know what happened to Phillip. He took on a new identity as a New York real estate developer. This is the greatest sleeper cell story in Russian history. Congratulations Phillip Jennings aka Donald Trump. Does anyone notice the resemblance between Elizabeth and Melania?"
"Get off your ...... congress if this republican congress does not do anything about Trumps disgraceful speech still saying Putin is innocent we are in trouble America, what do Trump supporters have to say now especially the republican veterans"
Where is our national security? Should he be allow back in this country? He was so upset about the NFL taking a kneel during the nations anthem; looks to me like he‚Äôs on Putin‚Äôs and Russia defense.
This is one outrageous event after another!  It must be stopped!  Why have checks and balances in place if they are never enforced!  Pure treasonous acts!  Forget ‚Äúthe base‚Äù; the majority of Americans are enraged and disgraced!
"Anderson Cooper is the least qualified ‚Äúgossip reporter‚Äù from the entire entourage of mainstream media to be reporting on any issues of national/international importance. He lacks the skills, intelligence, knowledge, journalistic integrity and impartiality necessary to report accurately and without prejudice. 
He should go back to doing what he does best, conduct conversations regarding Stormy‚Äôs affairs and the likes."
Anderson cooper has become a joke!!  I always thought journalism was supposed to tell the facts not ones personal screwed beliefs.
I was always an Anderson Cooper fan. Not so much now. I can't believe everything I see on CNN. Their bias is clear. News should be based on facts not conjecture!
That's okay Trump supporters. Keep waving that American flag in one hand and the Russian flag in the other.... Justice is coming.
"Comrade Benedict Arnold on his way to the USA. I wonder how Sarah will try to spin this?
The White House is in full panic mode. Welcome him back with a pair of shiny handcuffs."
"Lol disgraceful? Shame on you, atleast Trump is honest and tells the truth unlike previous presidents. Let me guess now you are going to say that trump throws intel agencies under a bus? Cnn the most biased name in news."
"The media's job is to report the news,  not to give own views or networks view.  People can make their own mind up based.on facts and facts are consistently misconstrued by the opinions of people and reported as news.  Surely everyone knows what opinions mean. Opinions are like alpha hotels, (AH) everyone has one."
"Spot on Anderson, spot on! The Russians must have something BIGGLY on Trump for him to sell out his office and country in this manner! Ì†æÌ¥®Ì†ΩÌ∏è"
"Remember Trump said you're FAKE news.  CNN needs to follow FOX news as a role model network with some integrity and ethics, and  where real journalists work."
"Anderson Cooper: I cannot believe actually said ""one of the most disgraceful performances by an American president."" When have you EVER seen an American president do this?"
Anderson Cooper is the biggest disgrace to media reperesentation is history. Most biased and blatantly lying POS to ever get air time. Keep crying. Trumps got 2 terms chump!
"In that two hour meeting, Putin reminded Trump of the dirt he has on him. He gave Trump his propaganda talking points to deliver to the media and the American public. Trump is owned mind, body, and soul by Putin. Trump just made Russia Great Again."
This is what unfit President does! Takea  the word of Putin over the facts that have been proven. This is what America voted for. Trump has failed to protect us.
"No I didn‚Äôt vote for Trump. No I didn‚Äôt vote for Hillary. Trump is a Bigot Racist BUT. Is he doing a great job no, is he doing a good job YES. Does he want better trade for us (looks like it, we will see) Our we safer yes. Have we been getting hustled by paying 75-80% of every foreign 
affairs idea that the world is part of (hack yes we are)
Has being nice worked for decades, heck no. We are laughing joke to the world. Is Trump fixing that with tough ways that the world isn‚Äôt liking yes and I like it. I‚Äôve always been for talking to dictators cause it helps their people that have no voice and keeps up safe and less war. Great job Trump and Putin. No Russia Federation didn‚Äôt invade our election, some Russians intelligence that so called isn‚Äôt part of that government did. FBI is a joke. Hillary paid them all off. CIA does great around the world for intelligence but when they find a clue and don‚Äôt tell the FBI the month of 9/11 you kidding me. Great job Trump and Putin today keeping our peoples nations safe and the world. Keep talking and keep rocking but keep that eye close cause for continuous dialogue."
"Isn't this proof that trump is a putin puppet, maybe someone should be investigating trump & families bank accounts.... it's not rocket science all along, just a little commonsense."
This man calling himself a president needs to be impeached. The republicans defending him need to defend their oaths of office.
"Bots out in full force trying to downplay and deflect the obvious.  So easy to detect, just like the meddling and the collusion.  You ain't fooling anybody.  You are dealing with the best Intel in the world.  Mueller's coming."
No Anderson the sight of you is disgraceful and the things you do behind closed doors is really disgraceful! President Trump is making America great and now he's making the world great!
Cooper obviously doesn't understand that the majority of americans are fed up with dems/liberals.....
That press conference should have been x-rated...... we just saw trump bend over and let putin screw him
"He sounds like he knows much more and almost caved, to me. I personally am convinced that he knows and in my opinion there‚Äôs no proof Russia didn‚Äôt meddle."
That's because he wants Russia to help him with the mid terms and then help him get re elected.  It's a no brainer. Hes all bait and switch to his base. Omg and they eat it up.
A disgrace from day one.- writing was already on the wall during his fraud election . He doesnt favor america hes not for america he is for russia wth kind of clown represents america ? IS THIS A JOKE ?
"HOW ON EARTH IS THIS HAPPENING?? 
 it is 2018!! and the ‚Äûpresident‚Äú praises Putin for invading/ corrupting the election NO!!!! this is really a BIG issue Trump is going to sink the USA"
"There's got to be more to this than meets the eye... if not, high crimes and treason!

""The LOVE of money!"" Lord wake up this man that took on this grave responsibility to lead this great country!"
"Does Anderson say ""certainly""? ""...Russian leader certainly that I've..."". He does hesitate at that point but does he utter the word ""certainly""?"
"The world knows that this was not a real summit, that we have to endure the Trump era and that the world will continue it's serious politics soon as Trump left the stage. With the EU and NATO it's the same process. The Russians had Boris Yeltsin, the US have Trump. This era will pass."
Welcome to the United States of Russia still waiting for u guys to do something besides talk about doin something before it's to late
"United States leader are dictator if them don't like u they will do anything to distroy you ,if they were no Russia or China us would control the world suffering other country"
Putin was an INTELLLIGENCE AGENT!  Why in a million worlds does Trump think they can work together?  Does he not understand the concept of INTELLIGENT?
Disgraceful? He's trying to form an alliance with Russia. A nation America can never defeat. What's so disgraceful about that?
"This is one of the darkest days for the United States of America and her people.  Could you imagine Bush holding a press conference with Bin Laden and saying it was America's fault he attacked us, he believes Bin Laden instead of us. Trump is a traitor. He needs to go, now."
So what do you do when most of your patriots no longer agree with your president? Authoritarianism and being dominated by foreign powers are just not our thing.
"Oh so handsome Jim Acosta .... a thorn in their side, but we love you and Anderson Cooper. Keep it up guys! Thank you Christianne and David Bergman too."
"If USA was qualified on World Cup, the pouts will be sided with the russia team like what he is doing right now with praising putin and attacking his own people here and is doing that each and everyday, just to look good before his  traitor supporters, shame on the USA who is still allowing this to happen, I'm ashamed and everyone should be for what we have became and cannot go any lower than this and the worst is that the entire world is watching"
"Trump folds like a deck of cards, sad for this nation and it‚Äôs security. Wait until that tunnel is finished from Russia to Alaska."
"What else would Putin have said to the question of collusion, ""Yes I did it"",  Hell No. But, School Yard Bully collaspes constantly, when he's in a room with another Leader of a country. I wonder if Putin is still interested in building Trump's condos??"
"David, this isn't funny.  Our great country is going down the tubes thanx to the traitor in our White House."
Trump sold out America.  Wake up people...putin owns trump and now our country...English will not be the main language it will be Russian
"Couldn't agree more, Anderson!

Trump is tough on our allies, but a pussycat with his enemies 
#TrumpIsUnfit #NotMyPresident"
Anderson Cooper? You mean the guy who called all conservatives ‚ÄúTeabaggers‚Äù? If you don‚Äôt know what that means I‚Äôll be glad to explain!
"Trumps presidency is worse than 9/11. Pearl Harbor, and Vietnam all rolled into one.  He makes Jane Fonda look like a patriot."
Go Trump..real Americans are behind you so disregard the liberals against you--remember they supported Obama and Hillary!
"I thought for a few minutes I had played a re run of SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE,,,It is so sad...BUT I said it a thousand times he is a bag of hot air..Now it is time our Statesmen and States Women make plans to throw him the hell out of office!!!!"
"Dear Trump Supporters,

The guy you voted for just sided with Russia over his own intelligence community AND his country. 

Please defend this. Go ahead. It‚Äôs not fake news it‚Äôs his own words."
"OMG! Trump selling America out again.  When will he give up on throwing the issue off topic by blaming Hillary and other American institutions.  And, it was rather telling that Putin was hesitate to answer when asked what he had on Trump.  Trump has such an inflatable ego, the size of the Baby Trump balloon I would estimate, that he can't see what a fool he is making of himself and of America.  He is not making America great.  He is making it weak and impotent."
I have never been more ashamed of a president in my entire life. I sat here and watched this lovefest and it just made me sick and mad. To side with Putin over our own allies and intelligence  agencies is beyond my comprehension. Of course Putin denied interfering in our elections even though we now have proof. I can strongly deny I am a white male but that does not change the facts or evidence to the contrary.
"I totally agree with Anderson.  And I like how Fox tried to make this about Obama.  This has nothing to do with Obama, this is about treason by the current resident of the White House."
"Thanks Anderson,I‚Äôm so angry right now I can hardly breathe,he‚Äôs got to go,he‚Äôs caused nothing but,shame and disgrace to America not to mention Hate and disrespect."
Putin did offer to let Mueller investigate the 12 men in Russia as long as his team gets to investigate our spies in the US!
"Amazing how little our Mr Trump has become. Disgraces GB PM May, belittles NATO, and then cowers to (ras)Putin. I wonder what the Russians have on him."
"We are now witnessing the orchestrated dismantling of the United States of America as was Founded, by a Treasonous thug and his enablers in the Republican Congress and Senate. The public denigration of our Intelligence officers and DOJ, and the capitulation to a foreign enemy Dictator is Treason, through and through. It is a dark day for our nation and our western allies. God help us, because we know the Republican Party who caused this, won‚Äôt. This is their coup."
"Who is Anderson Cooper for me to care about his opinion?
I am sure he is not that important or at least no to the level of Trump and Putin."
When are all of you going to grow up and accept the will of hard working Americans. Trump not only won but he swept the vote. Enough of all you guys bashing a great President. Do you really believe that we all loved Obama but we did not act like embittered folks for 8 years. Get a life people and help make America great again
CNN has their finger on the heartbeat of the west coast and the east coast and has completely lost touch with the heart of our country and he rest of the world
"Such deep sorrow?
Helsinki a launchpad -
A pivotal moment cemented.
Denials too absurd to
Contemplate.
We are lost to decency
When our Leader succumbs
To moral and character
Flaws laying bare a decline -
Ineptitude?
Tears Ì†ΩÌ∏≠ 
Woe is us!
Woe is us!"
Do you honestly believe Russia is the only country meddling with other countries?  They all do it! Including the US.
"Im sure Trump still believes his claim about the 400 pound guy in a basement that caused interference is still what He probably believes.
His buddy 
Putin would never interfere in any country and their election. Ì†ΩÌ∏ù 
If Trump is not going to believe in this country then he needs removed from office.
Not trusting a guy who has his nuclear codes at his disposal
What‚Äôs really frightening is to see how many US citizens with Jim Jones mentality. Scary"
"It's funny how every day Trump does something else to make me hate his guts. I have never seen such a cowardace man in my entire life. How any of you supposedly ""tough"" Trump supporters can even stomach this man after he bent over today and let Putin have his way with him. Trump should trade his MAGA hat for a # metoo hat cause he just got abused."
Trump is only performing for 33% of the country. He will hear all this along with that massive protest and he will have 2 or 3 rallies to boost up his spirit again. Same cycle.
"I agree completely!! It was like being in the Twilight Zone! It should not matter who's server got hacked DNC or RNC not acceptable!! Politics aside it is our Democracy that was attacked. I respect the office but the one who shall not be named has disrespected our intelligence and our Nation!!! If Obama did this OMG! Everyone would have gone insane!!! He would be Impeached before he landed at Andrews Air Force Base. Why, not be who shall not be named!!!!!"
Trump swears he so patriotic and yet holds Putin higher than our AMERICAN institutions....he's treating Russia and Putin better than his own country
Even if he stood up there and have the cure for cancer you guys would say it‚Äôs horrible so biased it‚Äôs incredible
How much information did Obama have vs trump? Wasn't it speculation and possiblitues when Obama was in office? Now that it's definitive trump should have no questions about what should be done.
"If you still support 45 after what was said today,  you are an ignorant brainwashed fool! You also do not care for this country! Absolutely disgusting & disturbing!"
"Complete and udder embarrassment.  I'm literally astonished.  Even Fox News said it was pathetic, so that really says how bad it was."
No president has ever done so much for foreign affairs. Meeting with Putin no president has done that. He‚Äôs doing a good job but will never get credit from all the hatters.
One reporter asked Putin if he was blackmailing Trump. Now when did you ever hear a credentialed legit reporter ask a question like that. Putin made a joke on it but actually didn't deny it. At that moment Trump looked over to Putin.
Go Anderson Cooper! You're on the right track. I really think there's something seriously wrong with him! How could any President put on a performance like that? It's amazing to me that people voted for him.
I'm so glad this case will be tried in the courts and not the media because too many dumb number 45 supporters would allow this to continue. I am so glad that it would be placed squarely on the shoulders of a judge who would have to think about what his life would be like living in America if he didn't follow the law on this case.
"Seems that everyone in the US has taken sides. One side will be very disappointed and have to concede that the others were right. I hope like hell that it's the majority that's wrong. Because if we are right...well, that would be horribly bad. We see the blinking neon lights and a freight train headed straight for the US... Again, I hope we are the ones that are wrong...United we stand, Divided we fall. Hold on folks!"
"It was appalling!  The very fact that they met in a totally secret setting is suspicious.  That Putin and others have Trumps private cell number, and communicate with him using it, circumvent the official line, so the calls can be recorded for historical records is worrisome."
"Trump bullied our allies and then became spineless in the presence of Putin. I was appalled by how deferential Trump was to Putin, not to mention having to listen to him criticize our allies, our own intelligence agencies and our free press. It was laughable when Putin offered to investigate the interference that he ordered. I have to wonder if the people who are defending Trump's performance were listening to the same press conference that I saw."
"Putin has BIG compromising stuff on trump and Trump the hell knows it! ‚ÄúVlad, please, please, never release that tape, I had so much fun with your girl agents, that pee bath, only you would have thought of that, Vlad, how much fun was that, so fantastic, Vlad! If Melanie sees that, she‚Äôll never, I mean, never, pee on my face again!‚Äù"
"Bernie wasn‚Äôt even a Democrat....and any information you received was obtained thru illegal collusion with a foreign enemy...Obama did not bug Trump...Why wouldn‚Äôt you expect Brazil to provide questions? She‚Äôs a life long Democrat. That‚Äôs basic politics. The Steele Repoert was funded initially by the Right Wing think tank until they realized Trump would get the nomination...Steele then offered it to the DNC as ‚Äúoppositional research‚Äù. Why wouldn‚Äôt they buy it, most of it was true! And on and on and on"
"At least 11 or 12 republicans in congress agree with Anderson Cooper, & of course all the democrats do."
Since our taxes paid for that ‚Äúsummit‚Äù don‚Äôt we have the right to a transcript of their private meeting?
It doesn‚Äôt surprise me that some Trump supporters don‚Äôt seem to understand what Trump has said on the World Stage. He has sided with an adversary in believing Puttin didn‚Äôt hack into our elections. You can‚Äôt say you believe our intelligence community then say you side with Puttin. Trump took an oath to protect and serve the United States and broken that oath by what he said today.
"A President who called on a foreign adversary for help, and received it  to win an election, should be subject to Constitution Art. II Sec. 4 The President..shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for and Conviction of Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors."
"Donald Trump said he blames US foolishness for the Russian situation. I agree, there is no greater foolishness, than electing a Buffon as POTUS."
"Time to meet this man when he returns with protests. Protests at the white house, golf courses and anywhere he goes. We need to be heard and it has to be loud and clear!!"
"Everyone needs to just take a deep breath and step back. By morning, Trump will deny ever having said any of this...he‚Äôll take it back. 

It‚Äôs fine. Everything is fine. Don‚Äôt look behind that curtain..."
"Treason. Collusion. Human rights violations. Impeach him now, he's hurting his own people-our country."
Make America Great Again? This is winning? It's plain to see that 45 was bought and paid for a long time ago.
CNN is one of the most disgraceful ‚Äúnews‚Äù organizations that has ever claimed to be a news organization.
"The anti 'donald' backlash might be enough to start getting things fixed again. 1st Stop after Nov. 6, Impeachment. However, expect the Russian hacking operation to make a mess of things, again."
"First off, trump isn‚Äôt our legal president. He is a fake and guilty of treason, as is most of his family and close associates. Trump and Putin both stood up and lied to the world, but we are supposed to believe them. There are those of us who just aren‚Äôt that gullible and the resistance is growing. I bet the crowd at his execution will definitely be bigly. Finally he will get the huge crowd he has bragged about."
"Anderson, I must agree, to hold a meeting with this person after the information he just received if he still had doubts just shows he just doesn't care, if it didn't work in his favor it would have been a different story, the poisoning, the killings, the evil, but it makes you wonder"
Unbelievable chatter about all this trump Putin circus.  The truth is no matter what all the left or right say or not say..... It presents as Treasonous behavior and betrayal of the American intelligence agencies.   The truth will set us all free after the mid-term elections and the realignment of the congress.  Trump is not presidential and should be removed as commander in chief ASAP!
Is it just me or do both Don and Melania seem much more comfortable/relaxed/comfortable in Finland and with Putin than anywhere else in the world?  I vote we call Airforce One home and leave them where they are happy.
"Now that Trump is home, in Russia, he should stay there. He is Treasonous. He proves it time and time again."
"A very strong message to Europe!! Mr. Putin was well prepared even taking notes while Trump was speaking, Trump was nodding his head in agreement to everything Mr.  Putin was saying...Mr. Putin was stronger, and came out of this meeting today the bigger man. European governments have serious decisions to make on how we go forward from here,  surely they know by now that Trump was doing Mr. Putin's work for him."
"So on a world stage, he crapped on his own country‚Äôs work. And you want to talk about making this country great? Hey America, I know we have thing about not admitting mistakes, but I think it‚Äôs about time to fess up and move on. He‚Äôs made a joke of everything. America elected someone that isn‚Äôt fit to run a mattress store."
Disgraceful indeed! What does Putin have over Trump!! He is certainly not acting for our nation‚Äôs safety!
"Get  over it , Anderson! We have entered a new non-ideological era. The old political establishment is obsolete; stop defending it.."
so when is Benedict Darn Old going to give Snowden a presidential pardon?  after the midterms?  register now and vote the Russian collusion hiding Republican congressional majority out this November.
"This makes me sick to my stomach that this is happening to our country and no one is stopping him. I use to love this country, I was so proud when I saw our flag flying and heard the the national anthem, I no longer have any feelings for this country. He has completely ruined that for me. My father fought in WWII for this country and the European allies that he is disrespecting came and helped and I know my father was proud that they were there. I had other uncles that also fought and I know they would not approve of this man that disrespects the allies that were there to help when the US A needed them. Now hes siding with a Russian dictator. Don't talk to me about being a patriot, this is not my country, this is Trumps country, and don't tell me I should respect this person because he is the potus!!!"
"Putin is drinking vodka now and laughing at the dunce we have for a president. It's embarrassing, and beyond embarrassing, it's dangerous. It's time for those in places that can act on this to do so because our president has no idea what he's doing. His ego is so inflated, he thinks he's untouchable and can do and say whatever he pleases and his base will support him. It's not okay. Few things he's done since taking office are, and with a little distance, history will show this is the worst president the U.S. has ever had to endure. Pitiful."
It amazes me the people truly believe that it is ok for #45 to praise Putin.  I guess they want the US to be like Russia.
"The days just continue to become more tragic for our country,Our democracy,our citizens,sold out by Trump-he is paying Putin for his election win-Things are only going to keep on this downhill trek..so disgraceful,no end to this madness in sight"
Let's check those ratings before giving weight to anything CNN has to say. Oh LOOK who's in the sewer. Bahahaha
"I remember when trump was running for president he said,‚Äù the world is a mess, but I‚Äôm here to fix it‚Äù, then I thought does he think he is God. I actually think his followers think he is, in their blind eyes trump walks on water"
Remember when Trump said if he shot someone on 5th ave this followers wouldn't care? Don't count on them to care now either they are too high on the Trump kool-aid on their Trump train blinded from reality lol
Save us all with this man in power. What a joke he has made our country. We need help. Republicans you are in power to do something to rid us of the crazy man. Vote all republicans out unless they act.
Please call the House Judicial Committee and let them know how you feel after watching this take down of our country. (202)225-3951 . They are logging people's feedback. Please call and make your voice heard.
"He was selling hotel rooms, doing real estate deals all of his working life.  He was the king of his money empire.  Why do we expect him to be a global thinker, understand American power or our democracy.  Scholars study it for goodness sake.  Highly complicated.  It is like asking a secretary to be play the violin with no training.  He doesn‚Äôt represent all Americans because he doesn‚Äôt and will never have that connection.  You need to be a politician, you need experience.  And Presidents need to care.  Of course it is confusing - he is winging it because he is way out of his comfort zone.  

We put a man with no experience or training in this sacred office.  And he doesn‚Äôt have the temperament or humility to learn.  The Russians wanted him in there for a reason and no doubt played him and his core team for years.  Did they make Syria worse to flood Europe with refugees?  

Russia has always studied America and Europe‚Äôs leaders and those that can undermine.

Trump won‚Äôt change - he is 70 plus years old and two years ago he was selling hotel rooms, casinos and real estate - that is his world."
"WHY, please tell me WHY our elected officials allowed him to be in a one on one meeting with this dangerous person?  Trump will never tell us the truth about their conversation - I'm not sure he even remembers.  What a sad day for us all!"
"Here life-long former democrat (now independent) 
To you Liberals with any common sense...  All the evidence to prove the truth of what happened has been deliberately obstructed and destroyed:

1)  The FBI was denied access to the hacked DNC servers which mysteriously disappeared...  The servers would have shown who had hacked them...

2)  Seth Rich, a DNC staffer upset with Bernie Sanders being admittedly sabotaged, was shot in the back 3 times with nothing taken...  All the hacked emails were found on his laptop which somehow got bleached while in the possession of the police...

3)  Hillary deliberately bleached and destroyed her FBI subpoenaed server and phones...

4)  Mueller has no evidence of who hacked the DNC and Hillary without their servers...

5)  Strzok basically admitted that Mueller's investigation was started on Hillary's unvetted fake dossier, but the Left is fighting tooth and nail to prevent disclosure of the documents that started the investigation...when they should be wanting disclosure to support their allegations with the American people...

The Left's obstruction to prevent the truth from being exposed could not be any more obvious...

#WalkAway"
"Trump is totally compramized, you can't see the ring in his nose but it is there with putins initials on it"
"‚ÄòIndeed‚Äô, only Trump and Putin know what‚Äôs going on between them. When the person looking for the needle has his own feet on it, it becomes difficult to uncover it. USA is in deep trouble with this President. May God help and keep blessing this United States of America!"
"Well all you Trump supporters what do you have to say now.  They smile in your face and want to take your place, the back stabbed. Lying #45 just sold America out! And Mueller is about to take the Trump crime organization down soon.  Obama, no drama for 8 years - so those that don't like # 44, kiss him where the sun doesn't shine."
"and they said it right there, The orange moron would rather take the word of a murderer, a thug, a horrid man, or his own country, his own investigating party.. what does that say??  Anyone who still believes in this moron.. I just don't know what to think.."
He performed like all traitors. Committed treason in front of the world. He proved Mueller's case for him.
"I call this teamwork and making allies. Asking for those opponents AKA traitors emails is possibly the best request. #SethRich did his best and died doing it, but it wasn't forgotten."
"Please impeach trumpf for TREASON to our country!!! I highly respect Senator McCain and others who speak truth!!
This is a calculated threat to our nation!!! He must be removed from office!!!"
"Do you people really think  our president was wrong? I love every word he said, the FBI and the DOJ lie on hime constantly! I stand by my president! He was right about everything he said!"
I will never imagine that I will be witnessing a such d√©sappointement from a seating pr√©sidente of the United States unbelievable what a shame I don‚Äôt even know if should I be sad hungry or simply embarrass this need to stop ASAP by our legislature.
CNN CSNBC when will guys ever report the positive truth about our President! Low ratings they will try anything!!
"A very BAD side of America is squirming, none of their baited hooks has caught a fish. No matter how hard they try... fail fail fail. CNN is part of the mechanism hanging on to the mega losing side.  But hey, I'd probably lie too, for the paycheck they get."
OMG. The powers (?) has succeeded in creating a robotic humanoid and has managed to place it in charge of the USA to bring us down. It reports to Putin. Life in the USA is spiraling down.
"IF YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT TREASON LOOKS LIKE, THIS IS IT! It‚Äôs literally been proven EXACTLY who hacked American election, the Russian Military ordered by Putin and Trump still meets with him and is all smiles! 
#LOCKUP45"
So tired of the disrespect toward our President.  Anderson Cooper should research facts instead of his ignorant opinion.
I don‚Äôt know why but I continue to be amazed by the actions of this guy. How can you stand there and throw your own intelligence group under the bus but then say you have confidence in them? I knew this guy was of low character and low morals but this takes the cake!  It is obvious that there is something more this relationship with Putin than just wanting to get along. He calls him a competitor but claims the EU are our foes?  I feel sorry for the people that continue to follow and support this guy relentlessly. I don‚Äôt know what that juice is that he‚Äôs made you all drink but you‚Äôre acting in the same manner as those that followed Jim Jones.
"Embarrassment, disgraceful, move your stocks quickly!  True colors are appearing daily. No matter what party you are how can you not see what this human being is doing to the ‚Äúworld‚Äù. He is just beginning!"
Dtrump should be arrested and tried for treason as soon as he lands air force one.  Everyone in his cabinet and those republicans that have covered his butt.
Isn't there something more important to talk about with Russia than to dwell on how Trump won the election? It is like people are still in the 5 stages of grief that he won. 1. Denial 2. Anger 3. Depression 4. Bargaining 5. Acceptance. It seems like many of us are just circling around denial & anger. This is a waste of Russia's time. They aren't going to want to have anymore meetings. The media is the real embarrassment.
THIS is why after decades I no longer watch CNN. No longer about news reporting but left wing personal opinions.
You‚Äôre the most disgraceful news anchor I have ever seen also! You are scum Anderson!! Can‚Äôt wait till you are out of a job for producing such horrible lies and shameful news stories!! Ì†æÌ¥¢Ì†æÌ¥¢Ì†æÌ¥ÆÌ†æÌ¥ÆÌ†æÌ¥ÆÌ†æÌ¥ÆÌ†ΩÌ±ãÌ†ΩÌ±çÌ†ºÌøªÌ†ºÌ∑∫Ì†ºÌ∑∏

"Hillary told you guys during the campaign that Trump is going to be Putin ""puppet"" and you guys didn't believed her. I guess you can now see for yourself. Putin  puppet!"
"If DT doesn't do and say what Putin wants he loses his power, his money and more than likely his life. Why would Donald do what he's doing so blatantly? It doesn't make since."
"I used to be proud of what the Republican Party stood for . . . Not any more.  They need to denounce this president and everything he is doing.  Trump and his party are going to destroy hundreds of years of positive democratic influence on the world.  Trump has alienated our allies in favor of Putin who wants to see us destroyed.  Good God, Trump openly admires Putin and I swear if Trump could find a way to subvert the Constitution he would set himself up to be just like Putin.  It is embarrassing and frightening."
"Absolutely typical Trump to try and change the topic, such as bringing up Hilary Clinton.  He insults the intelligence of rational, intelligent  people which precludes any of his supporters."
"This shows the evil intentions of this Beelzebub, he is more concerned that Putin help him get re-elected than he has concern for America!  If this does not open his supporters' eyes then they are numb*%#"
"Get off it, Anderson!  I used to think you were unbiased and open-minded until I heard you this AM on CNN."
"It's a disgrace to American democracy for a President deflect his own problems onto someone else's, Clinton's emails is irrelevant, it doesn't has nothing to do with it, but the fact remains that the DNC computers were hacked into and federal investigation into whether or not Russia was involved."
"Didn‚Äôt he consistently have a guilty look on his face, compared to his usual pompous look? Over his head with Putin."
"Reporter: would you like to take this opportunity to screw up any possible diplomacy you might be trying to achieve today?

Trump: Well... No. Thanks for the attempt to sabotage the meeting though.."
"This is what u get Trump and putin go deep real deep and they want nothing more then to rule the world,but at what cost,I've said it from the beginning the movie Hunger games makes more sense everyday"
CNN is not a credible news source.  Just look at their ratings.  They don't even have a single show in the top 25 Nielsen ratings.  Trump has done an excellent job in exposing CNN as fake news.  And the american people have listened.
"Thank God I am not American. And for those of you who are - look around the world, take a brave step and get out, this Fascist will bring you nothing but shame and hurt."
If Trump colluded with the Russions can someone explain to me how Russia got their hands on our uranium?
Count me in on team Anderson.  Thank you for your excellent reporting and calling it like it is.  #FREEPRESS  #LOCKTRUMPUP
And Obama promising flexibility to Russia and sending pallets of taxpayer cash pallets to Iran are honorable?
Oh stop it.  He is right at the time ... he could not trust our govt.  The hearings are proving that. Every country spies on the other. It is reality.
"One can‚Äôt help but wonder if DJT is Putin‚Äôs Trojan horse put into the White House by the Russians to destabilize both the US and the EU.  Everything Putin says and doesn‚Äôt say would lead one to believe so.  Never mind what DJT says, since that‚Äôs all lies anyway.  Disgraceful performance by a POTUS whose job it is to protect the American people and the constitution, including free and secure elections, against foreign enemies."
"Putin has PEE PEE Tape and MONEY that was giiven to The Orangutan.   I would like American to watch it.   Someone please put it out there.   We have a SIMPLETON for president.

"I will say this again and again.
After the disgraceful ""press conference"" and as indication of what the meeting with president Putin was, Twitler should be either indicted or impeached for treason.
Or stupidity!"
Go vote in November to take back congress and neutralize Trump. Only then can we work on repairing the damage that has been done to our democracy.
I wonder what all of the Trump supporters think of Donald Trumpy now!! Looking so weak in front of his Russian boss Putin!!
"""Make America Great Again""!  What a joke.  For the first time in my 67 years, I'm ASHAMED of our U. S. President.  And the rest of the world is laughing at us . . . . ."
It was treason to say LGB leader Putin is more honorable then our own  CIA and the FBI and Intelligence agencies.
"Praising a thug who's political rivals end up dead and all their assets end up in his pocket, a thug who invaded a sovereign country Ukraine and forcefully stole an entire region because it used to be Russian, a thug who poisons people with dangerous substance with no regard for standers bye, A thug who commissions an entire division of the government to play internet trolls and disrupt rival nations, is disgusting. All of this, and we have Americans upset by kneeling at a football game and asking to do something about the rampant gun violence in America? Wake up and get your pitchforks."
Ha ha! the globalist war mongers cannot believe that peace is happening!  They love war! they hate peace...  Cold war is OVER so great!
Trump is scared shitless of Putin.  Come on.  He knows if he crosses him he will be dead.  I bet he hasn't eaten since he got to Helsinki.
Fake news CNN....Bad news channel and the taste of real news never ever found good in the side of CNN when it comes to The Great President Donold Trump who stands up America first. you fake news CNN..bye bye
I have a hard time imagining anything more disgraceful......but Anderson Cooper has seen more than I have............
"He‚Äôs most likely Russian citizen by investment acting under that law of dual citizenship. ‚ÄúFirst and foremost Russian...‚Äù 

Please address this. Settle the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù"
Cooper lives in a dream world and is only relevant to the liberals. His opinion means NOTHING to staunch conservatives with values and common sense.
He‚Äôs a traitor and should never be allowed to set foot in the White House again. He doesn‚Äôt deserve the honor of being President
"Media just keep complaint but know nothing about the insider, President Trump own an explaination the purpose of te meeting to American people"
"Based on what had been learned this year about our FBI and Justice Dept., I'm more inclined to believe Putin that our on corrupt agency's."
Coopers idiotic trashy media blather is really a bore. His Queen of the Media thing is a Much Bigger Bore!
"America 1st uh, yeah right!Ì†ΩÌ∏à The puppy master is still pulling the strings and Americans will only stand by and watch how the series unfold. It's such a shame... smhÌ†ΩÌ∏¶ Repugnicans should be held culpable. There's no excuse for this international embarrassment. #RussianPuppet"
"The only narrative where wrong doing is being evoked, and the Law was broken to do so. If you really want to validate your story, you clowns that broke the law own it. It is easy to explain the harm done by the leakers. If due process is a political and social construct,"
"Putin met yesterday with the Sudanese dictator Omer Al elbasher ,it‚Äôs okay they‚Äôre all happy dictators family meet, and that‚Äôs including our dictator in the making Donald Trump."
Who is Anderson to judge? He is so far to one side. I just feel if your reporting the news stay in the middle show no preference for either side or parry
Every day the last 1¬Ω years with Mr. Trump is so surprisingly and saturated with new content. The last week I just lost the red thread in the White House policy. It is a mess ‚Äì and the red thread is gone!
Because he knows if he even says hillary than all attention is off him once again.. outrage!!! Get him out!!! Whats going on in there???
One day you will al look back and say What the hell did we vote for? Your kids and grandkids will ask the same question. RIP USA
"Anderson, you're getting paid to do the news not voice your personal opinions. Oh wait, you work for CNN, it's what you all do!"
There seems to be a new rise in bots and trolls lately (has anyone else noticed this).  They briefly declined on FB and now there back in numbers.
"Everyone needs to vote in their primary coming up next month and in the November elections.... everyone take your family, take your friends, take your neighbors and get to the polls. This needs to end."
Terri Lyda put this one up on your page and see if the doubters don‚Äôt see the truth now! Trump siding with Putin over his own intelligence agents. This is treason against his own country.
"Agree wholeheartedly! I thought he was the ""America First"" president. Sounded more like an apology, no, a surrender summit!"
Impeachment or jail. Enough is enough with this traitor. This kind of behavior is not normal for a President. The GOP better open their eyes.

"What ever happened to newsman who just reported the news, and let the audience form their own assessment? Not your call to make, Mr. Cooper."
"To all the Trump supporters, how is this putting America first? Siding with the Russian leader, is that what you call putting America first?"
I'm from abroad and I just can't believe my eyes witnessing what I just saw in that news conference Ì†ΩÌ∏≥Ì†æÌ¥¢.
When Muller‚Äôs Investigation has concluded  then trumps supporters can put all the pieces together and I‚Äôm hoping they finally understand
Oh you big babies. He did just fine. I love our president and I think hes great and I'm voting for him again in 2020. #WalkAway #WhatBlueWave
US People should come out in record numbers to protest his return to the US. He is a TRAITOR!  Should be met by ICE at the US border and put in a cage!!
Cooper go home and stay there.You are not the voice pf America.Your bias remarks do not belong on tv.You are to report the news and keep your hate full opinions to yourself.

#RussianAssetTrump tweeted to blame his own treason on the US & Special Counsel Mueller's investigation for the reason there is poor US-Russia relations rather than Russia's interference in the election; whined that President Obama had thought crooked Hillary was going to win the election, so when he was informed by the FBI about Russian meddling, then he said it couldn't happen so no big deal & did nothing about it & when he won then it became a big deal then the rigged witch hunt was headed by Strzok

So is Trump entertaining the notion that Putin's intelligence operations could sort out American cyber security lapses?
We just witnessed the selling out of America. And now we will witness all the phony patriot trumpstards defending the traitor trumpster.  Disgusting

Ok so how many summits with an American president and Russian president has Anderson seen? The question about giving up the indicted individuals is this.

"Our president is a traitor, start the impeachment hearings immediately!"
"Putin must have way more then just a pee tape on Trump. We have a rogue President, and half the country doesn't want to face the facts."
If he spoke like this in front of cameras--can you imagine what he said in the privacy of the meeting??????
"Not sad, not shocking, not surprising.  Nothing less than treason.  Trump is an agent of Russia.  Congress, do your job!"
"One of the 7 signs of fascism is when confronted with a crime, never answer but point out someone else's crime."
At least now we know why this was the easiest for Trump. All he was going to do was shake hands and agree with everything he had to say.
"Here's a thought: Don't embarrass and call him out during a live summit in front of millions while testing diplomacy. Also, all countries meddle in elections. Doesn't make it right, but how about we fortify our own election process in order to lower the chances of foreign countries having a hand in the outcomes."
Cry my country cry! We have been sold to Russia!
45 needs to be arrested for treason as soon as he steps off the plane on American soil.  ENOUGH IS ENOUGH!
You are correct Anderson Ì†ΩÌ∏±Sad day for America Ì†ΩÌ∏™
When are we going to do something about this sorry excuse for a potus a total disgrace to America. Cant believe anyone who voted for him still support him after todays meeting with putin. Russia owns him that is obvious. So sad
We are watching treason.
An utter disgrace to America and the office he holds.

Fox News basically saying what Anderson is saying also. Trump embarrassed the USA.
"Putin OWNS the president of the USA. He must go- in any way possible, as soon as possible!"
"This is another roll-your-eyes-moment+, Mr. Cooper.  Actually, rolling eyes isn't enough any more, is it, AC?"

"As the entire WORLD witnesses the embarrassment of the US President, the Russian trolls are flooding CNN with new conspiracies and cries of fake news."

"And who the hell is Anderson Cooper, just another dumb democrat."
"Of course, Anderson Cooper thinks that. Isn't it time to let all this vitriol go?"
"Dear Trump Supporters, 

You‚Äôre President just sided with Russia and blamed his people (CIA, FBI, HLS, Armed Forces intel) for giving out false information! 

He chose Russia over his own country. This man should be arrested for treason when he lands. 

I will no longer display a flag until this man is out of office. 

How can you possibly support him now? How?"
"Remember it not just Trump, Kelly, Pomeo and Bolton were all there, thus accomplices in this 'treason'. :-)"
Face it. That was the president of the United States giving comfort and aid to an enemy state before an international audience. Period.
In all the time this problem with Russia has been going on I haven't seen any sentor go over to try and break bread with them
"Putin just gave us the truth about their Bromance: ""President Trump, WHEN HE WAS A CANDIDATE, he mentioned to me that..."" 
There you go, Mr Mueller!!! Ì†ΩÌ∏±"
But there‚Äôs no ‚Äòcollusion‚Äô going on! Ì†ΩÌ∏ë Trump said so!!
"Its CNN... so,....  there's no credibility to begin with in my opinion."
"CNN the hate network. Incites hate and division for a US president, cop hate race hate. Any topic that causes divisions CNN will relentlessly shove it in your face."
Yeah!! Ask all your cronies what they think of course you‚Äôre going to downgrade Trump. The fact that he respects outing for his strong leadership is within his character. There is mutual respect even though we‚Äôre foes.
Amen to that. Please start the impeachment...
How any American can support trump after today is astounding!!!!
"We all saw what tRump said at the press conference.  If that is the garbage he is willing to spew, in full view of the entire planet, what was said behind closed doors in his one-on-one with Putin?"
Where is the server POTUS mentioned?  Why is it only this President is being investigated?
"The problem in the Trump Folks is they stand behind a guy who only got 25.4% of the votes and say ""We The People"" voted for him. Sadly they are happy with This. This is the show of a broken system. Clinton only got 25.6% and her peeps would be just as happy. This is a great sign of a broken system."
"Your right Mr. Cooper if this man was a legitimate President I would be greatly upset, as he is not I am more embarrassed for our country and those who actually believe this man!"
"All that effort to keep Trump from being elected did not work! Step aside and let the man do his job. If we succeed in getting our justice system to work as it was intended, those dems who actually DID collude, will be facing time."
"He should be impeached,  If this was Obama, Republicans would crap their pants"
If only Trump could like his contry as much as he like Russia.
Everyone please go to Fox News and comment so the Trump fans see how many people are disgusted by this MAGA fool
"Even Wolf Blitzer looks pissed. I don't care for Wolf, but I love the shock and disgust on his face. Every TRUE American had this look, no doubt"
"Well... golly gee... if unbiased, objective, sticks-to-the-facts Anderson Cooper says so...

LOL"
relax anderso  cooper and cnn...you still have two more years :D
"This is the Republican Party's fault.  A sitting ""president"" just sided with Russia/Putin again his own government.   VOTE 2018 BLUE"
Just when you thought our Colluder in Chief couldn't appear any more ridiculous on the world stage! Fortunately I think the world is smart enough to know what he spews doesn't mean anything about us...it just means orange boy is a crooked moron.
"Donald duck, ""make Russia great again"". A putin puppy and traitor"
I don't agree.  CNN is the most disgraceful FAKE MEDIA NEWS that I know.  Go Trump.
Russian trolls out in force today.
"Neville Chamberlain stood up to Hitler better than Putin's Poodle did today. Obviously there is a different bar for calling it what it is, Treason, whether it's a Dem or a Rep.    Trumpsters: Try for a lucid moment to imagine how you would react if Obama or Hillary had behaved in such a depraved way to a Russian Dictator."
Does anyone still listen to this garbage? I believe TMZ more than I believe CNN...
"Stop calling him President, no real US President sides with a Country that attacked us versus America."
"It figures , what else did we expect from this worm . Putin played him so well , Putin's puppet !!!!"
Who is hurt by closer relations with Russia? Might it be the military industrial complex?
People Of America Time To March On Washington Just Like G.B. Just Did. Shut America Down And Put A Stop To This MADNESS.
I agree with Anderson.....facts are facts.....our president and many of his followers chose to ignore them.   He is an#Americantragdey
Let me know when someone credible and important says that and not Cooper.
I call @andersoncooper the most disgraceful news reporters! What a double standard life he lives!
Disgraceful!!!  Act of treason for a United States President.
I could not understand how the president of the US went in like a child telling his daddy that he was sorry.Ì†æÌ¥îÌ†æÌ¥îÌ†æÌ¥î
Who the hell would listen to Anderson cooper anyway fricken moron
"The left is upset again because the media attempted to turn this press conference into a confrontation and a public shaming of Russia, working against our own president in an attempt to embarrass him, believing he would not retaliate in such a setting. But instead he turned it on them and agitated them even further. It's just fun to watch the media outrage"
I cannot believe I just watched Your president take a MASSIVE $h!t on america and praise the KGB Putin over US Intel!! #treasonsummitÌ†ΩÌ∏†
You and fake news are you guys not tired ? Leave president Trump alone he is making America proud
45 just handed us over to Russia with a silver platter no a gold platter-Impeach 45 now
Kissed Putin's behind and threw America in the toilet classic trump
CNN the haters! Fake news! Trump will defeat you all.
Why is it that pretty much EVERY SINGLE PERSON who has even the slightest bit of knowledge about Russian meddling/interference has voiced their concern EXCEPT OUR PRESIDENT?????? There are now 77+ indictments and arrests of people directly involved in this yet OUR PRESIDENT continues to say he‚Äôs not concerned AND he will not do anything about it???? WHY?????
"The person that's a disgrace, is Anderson cooper himself!"
What would anyone expect from CNN?
"It's official. Andersen Cooper is a sham of a journalist, and a total tool. Last shred of respect for him - now gone. Next."
----> LOVE THIS PRESIDENT.=  NO WAR LIKE cnn expected.
"Donald Trump, his crime family, his administration, his Trumpanzee base, the GOP and every Republican are Traitors to the United States of America. 16 previous indictments, 5 Guilty pleas from his administration and now 12 more indictments. But Donald Trump refuses to stand by our own US Intelligence agencies in favor of supporting Vladimir Putins assertions that Russia did not interfere with our elections. Where are Republicans in both the House and Senate? Crickets! #TRAITORS"
"What will it take to try him for treason? Trump committed treason on live TV.

18 U.S. Code ¬ß 2381 - Treason

Whoever, owing allegiance to the United States, levies war against them or adheres to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort within the United States or elsewhere, is guilty of treason..."
"True, disgraceful and treasonous on a he part of POTUS."
The POTUS taking the word of the Russian president over his own intelligence agencies.  Yikes.
"Como todo l√≠der ha hecho lo correcto, no le tuvo miedo al dictador norcoreano menos a Rusia, con todo respeto."
Cnn just cant get over Hillary Clinton.
Congress has blood on its hands.  Impeach!
Shame on dtrump- he is batshit crazy and a traitor.
We all think that Anderson Cooper
Maybe Russia will help us freeze Canadian exports!
Chorro de idiotas en Finlandia haciendo mucho dinero a cuestas de Trump!   IDIOTAS de CNN!
I can't believe Vladimir Putin doesn't speak any English!!!
I wonder how much more will he do before his supporters and the Republican party will realize the damage and danger he's doing. Then he talks about America first? There's no way anyone can look at this and say he's America first. He's about himself.
Trump THREW ALL OF US UNDER THE BUS!
Anderson Cooper don't know spit beans from coffee-a politically biased libtardcrat.
Anderson Cooper ranked 26th in News shows.  Doesn‚Äôt reach enough of an audience to be effective.
Did i hear him correctly...that Russia controls its citizens better than America?
Almost as big a joke as Anderson Cooper himself!
"Oh Anderson, we would not expect any other statement from you or CNN!!  At least you are consistent."
Really cnn? A frigging ad 20 seconds into a 4 minute video?
Trump &Putin conference is beyond tresserorous.  It's treason.
"Putin has something on trump, it is obvious and trump is selling out our country to protect himself."
"Jorge Luis Mu√±oz, seriously what the hell??? 
And yet there are still fools that are defending him Ì†ΩÌ∏°"
Hanging would be too good for him!
CNN = American version of Persian BBC.
"Thank you for your reporting, CNN."
He  needs to be tried for treason - no president should ever willingly compromise our cyber security.
STOP TREATING THIS LIKE IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL. IT'S TREASON!!!
Anderson Cooper needs to do more hurricane stories.
"Dear Mr. Putin:  CONGRATULATIONS.  Your country put on a great World Cup that was fun to watch start to finish and YOU put it on the President of the United States earlier today in Finland.  You've successfully gotten trump to publicly discredit our own American Intelligence Agencies in favor of russian believes and desires.  You got trump to disavow the value of NATO, humiliate our closest allies and essentially turn our political/social system into a mess. The KGB taught you well. Since you got the last laugh today on the U.S. how about sharing some laughs with the rest of the world by finally sharing what you have on trump be it the ""Golden Showergate"", the millions (billions) of dollars trump owes you in loans or anything else that would surprise and get 300+ million Americans to laugh along with you. If so - we'll all thank you and tip our glasses of vodka in your favor.  Spaciba."
i really dont dacre cnnÌ†ΩÌ∏ÇÌ†ΩÌ∏Ç
Cnn would call Jesus a dis grace! Is that anything new?
"Every time I have even dared question 45's actions, I get attacked usually by someone that I grew up with in suburban Nashville or similar person with limited world view.  Those same persons are quiet as a mouse today...."
"Gil And Norm.....I would have  wanted some backbone  from our president. I  am truly  amazed  that Putin didn't  break into laughter at Trump's responses.  12 Senior Russians indited and  we  are ""both to blame"" ?????"
And it is official we have a TRAITOR running the US. How shameful.
Ì†ΩÌ∏ÇÌ†ΩÌ∏ÇÌ†ΩÌ∏Ç CNN what can they say ? Always negative and discrediting !!
I think Anderson Cooper is about the poorest excuses for a man that I have ever seen!!!
"#DotardTrump is a mole of the Russian intelligence; and this is his ""employee review""... He will get new orders from his boss, Vladimir Putin..."
"""No prior president has ever abased himself more abjectly before a tyrant"" - Senator John McCain"
This is why it pays to vote cause otherwise you get stuck with limp dicks running everything Ì†ΩÌπÑ
I‚Äôm about ready to block CNN with all these trolls on it. Or maybe I just ignore it.
Where are your 3 pussy hats CNN DISGRACEFUL
We watched two greedy world leaders  conspire behind closed doors how to get can richer than they already are .
made me sick to my stomach to listen to this weak arrogant traitor side with Russia at our expense.
"Anderson Cooper, I'm extremely disappointed that you and all three of your guests didn't have the courage to call out DJTrump for COMMITTING TREASON TODAY.  Has he really been successful in bullying EVERYONE at CNN???  I believe, that both DJTrump and his VP, have each committed HIGH CRIMES AND MISDEMEANORS, BOTH;  and, that DJTrump has committed TREASON, PUBLICLY, TWICE NOW...ON July 27, 2016 AND now, on July 16, 2018.  Please have someone who agrees with at least these facts about committing TREASON, on you show, today!"
Right on Anderson Cooper.  Impeach this embarrassment
All the FOX NEWS viewers are up in arm about CNN broadcasting this story .
OF COURSE Anderson Cooper would say that. Certainly the script was prepared weeks ago! Ì†ΩÌ∏°
Anderson Cooper likes cock in his mouth so wtf does he know? He doesn‚Äôt even know the right place to put his dick
Who cares what that puts Anderson Cooper says! Unbelievable!!!
Anderson Cooper is a disgrace to this country with all hislies
One this was not a Summit it was a meeting 2 what is most disgraceful is CNN as a News Network
"Trump sides with Russia against his own intelligence agencies!!! This crazy!!! Trump has always side with PUTIN, because Trump owes RUSSIA money!!! To all TRUMPs  supporters this man doesn‚Äôt have the AMERICA people interest, he is only interested in making PUTIN and Russia happy!!!This type of action or the like of action should interest all Republicans, Democrats and Independents, that this President and his administration doesn‚Äôt care about you!!! What has this Administration done for the average Americans!!! Absolutely nothing!!!Enough said!!!"
"I watched the whole meeting without any commentaries by Mr. Cooper to begin with. This is the most disgraceful presentation of the American President, who undermined his own National Security Institutions in order to spit out his own agenda!"
"Que esconde trump que prefiere creer a Putin y no a sus investigadores....algo esconde o, algo le sabe Putin ..."
"Same old CNN, one is bad enough why do we need two?"
Your an idiot Anderson cooper! Like your opinion matters!
"JUST DESTROYING OUR JUSTICE DEPARMENT!!
HE IS JUST TELLING THE WORLD THAT OUR CIA,FBI ARE GOOD FOR NOTHING AND HAVE NO CREDIBILITY. 
SORRY IF TRUMP SUPPORTER DON'T SEE THIS WE ARE NO LONGER THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA!!"
"When did news casters start telling heads of states how to  do their meetings with other heads of states? Do you not understand that you really are nothing? Reporters, not even mayors, or city managers!!"
"So, who with any sense listens to CNN or Anderson Cooper??!!!!"
US. Code 2381 Treason Trump sided with Russians at Summit  TREASON
Putin and Trump = Friendship Forever! Ì†ΩÌ±ç People Ì†ΩÌ¥¥  please be clever and make friendship with another countries instead anger and hateness. Russia and Russian people are amazing you guys just have to be able to see this. And stop watching FAKE NEWS on your TV Ì†ΩÌ≥∫ coz they are lying and feeding you with various s*it. Read from an alternative sources and analyse.  Peace ‚úåÔ∏è
Anderson Cooper you are right on!
The only DISGRACE I see is CNN reporters.
Would anyone think Anderson Cooper say anything else? He already had his remarks written days ago.
they were Russians who messed with the election.
He has to Ì†ΩÌ±Ö daddy putins boots
Yea but what other US Pres was bailed out of Bankruptcy and helped elected by Russia?
WOW the Russian trolls and bots are in overdrive today.  Just like the warning signs at the zoo about feeding animals DONT FEED THE TROLLS
"Yeah, Anderson Cooper is the surest news source ever to exists."
After this I have lost all respect for Anderson Cooper
YOU LIFT THING The United States President  (Donald J. Trump) SAID...
I didn't know honestly anybody cared what CNN had to say anymore!Ì†ΩÌ≤©Ì†ΩÌ∏éÌ†ΩÌ∏Å
"You are the disgraceful one cooper 
 CNN the communist news network"
True: More people watch HGTV than watch CNN
"This is the same guy that said ""there were good people on both sides"" at a rally for white supremacists vs protestors. 

Of course he says we're both to blame. And oh, where are the emails? Trump says Putin offered assistance and that we might take it"
Putin has kompromat info about trup.maybe video trump with hookers in Moscow  hotel.
"You're a disgrace Anderson Cooper, a long with CNN!"
He SOLD OUT MAKE America great again for trump towers in Russia lmao
"yeah....well Anderson Cooper likes mens dicks in his butt hole, so......."
THE ONLY PEOPLE HE DON'T TRUST CNN ALL THE LIES
We truly have a moron for a president.
Now do you think Anderson Cooper would say anything nice or positive about our president?  No
Running scared‚ÄîMueller is closing in and all of this will come tumbling around him!!
"Fine example of treason when you choose to speak against our democratic system and saying negative things about the FBI and Muller investigation.Adding that the investigation is a witch hunt. He sides with our enemies. Now he wants the Russians come in to help investigate. NO,NO, NO!! That would absolutely be colluding with the Russians."
"DONALD TRUMP IS TRYING TO BE THE LEADER OF A ONE WORLD ORDER .,WITH THE HELP OF RUSSIA. .WE ARE IN A DARK PLACE ,IF EITHER OF THEM BECOME THE DICTATOR .,OR IN CHARGE .KEEP DEFENDING HIM IF YOU WANT ,IT WILL AFFECT YOUR FAMILY ,JUST LIKE OUR .PEACE"
WHAT ARE WE WAITING FOR?  Start the impeachment before he gets back.
Just when you think Trump can‚Äôt disgrace your country any further.
TRUMP HAS TO BE IMPEACHED!!!!!
There is a big difference between honest reporting news and the exaggerated daily criticisms from every attention getting liberal news caster on TV. I really think they are so delusional that they do not realize that fewer and fewer people believe them...........Some one tell me one good thing Anderson Cooper ever said about Our President Trump......CNN and Anderson are so bias they stink !    .....Russia been jerking off the last shiftless Obama administration and no-one said shi# .........Impossible is just a big word thrown around by small men ( the past four Presidents ) who found it easier to live in the world they‚Äôve been given than to explore the power they have to change it........Now we have President Trump....MAGA#
very sad day in our history of true Patriots. our very democracy is in danger!
"Thank you, Anderson. I couldn‚Äôt agree more."
"Agolf Twittler is a non American KGB operative,( Manchurin candidate)! PERIOD"
"As usual, the Trumpsters ignore the treason that is in front of their faces to bring out the same old broken record: ""Hillary did..."" ""Obama did..."" 

But here is what neither Hillary did nor Obama did, they didn't stand up with a Russian dictator at a Russian summit and betray the USA. That was Trump! Remember, Orange face, blond hair? That was all Trump!"
Sad day for America and the World......Rotten to the core...
DO NOT LET AIR FORCE ONE BACK IN THIS COUNTRY. IT CONTAINS TRUMP THE RUSSIAN AGENT
Republicans you let him do this...Now stop him
This lunatic needs to be gone NOW!!!! Ì†ΩÌ∏°Ì†ΩÌ∏°
ABSOLUTELY!!!!  What will be done about it when Bone Spurs returns??!!!! Why is it being tolerated??!!!!!
He could have ended the quote at the word President...
AC - you're the disgusting one.  WE LOVE PRESIDENT TRUMP!!!
Trump is the greatest threat to USA that has ever been. Our democracy is in terrible peril with him as ‚Äúpresident‚Äù.
Isn't treason impeachable?
How embarrassing this comments are against us American makes me cry
Outside perspective here after watching the debates and the coverage all the media was saying he is gonna be terrible and is gonna start wars and world war 3 and it‚Äôs gonna be the end of the world now that he is stopping wars happening he is still the worst Ì†ΩÌ∏íÌ†æÌ¥î
Would the last American exiting Washington DC please get our flag?
I agree with Mr Brennen. His actions are nothing less than treason
I agree totally. What a disgrace. When does impeachment apply?
And this moron was allowed to meet in Private ??!!!   WE should ALL be scared !!
Trump was formerly a Democrat.  Did he find the other major party easier to dupe?
The silence from Republicans is deafening and tells you everything you need to know about values and American ideals
No cnn you are. We have move on get together. Of course you want to keep people against each other‚Äôs. That‚Äôs cnn because your mad your demos didn‚Äôt get picked.
A very sad performance for the USA.
Drumpfster went to go seee his Booo again... Ì†ΩÌ∏Ç Can't get enough Putin
"Treason, calls for a hanging....and start learning Russian,  cause we just got sold!!!"
I mean CNN should love russia. Both love socialism
I‚Äôm in total agreement with Anderson. What a repugnant and gutless character. A disgrace to America!
Can we not let him back into the country?? Please??
I am so ashamed of this president ‚Äî and so afraid for America‚Äôs future.
Nothing from the Trump trolls.  No way to defend this.
TREASONOUS Kaitlin Shaw Megan Pendagast all Patriots for impeachment Ì†ΩÌπå
Can this man be served w treason papers when he lands?
"Anderson you‚Äôre the Disgraceful and most hateful reporter of the CNN media with all the Lies you people report , and you think we believe you just Ignorant like you will believe"
I cannot believe that this president through United States under the bus Russians help him be elected and he colluded with them it is so sad the president of Russia got something real bad on the president
What did you want him to do? Go over there and hit him in the mouth and tell him how much we hate him
"He is the worst version of the Manchurian Candidate ever , the dumbest and most embarrassing."
That‚Äôs CNN for you. Who CARES about what you think. Give us the news and facts.
"So what is next? What was the point of this summit? Are allies with Russia? I don't understand why trump didn't want to talk about the indictments, why? He was 100% with Putin. What's going to happen now?"
What else could you expect from CNN and it‚Äôs viewers?
How is this fake news when it played out on national television? Take your blinders off people! wtf
How can he say that when other Presidents have never given Russia the time of day.
I agree with Anderson... Utterly mind boggling!
Trump should be tried for high treason!
Our so called leader has failed America again. Congress has to step up.
Who the hell is Anderson Cooper. Is he white?
Trump has put our country last.outrageous
"Soooo we knew trump before he went there. Talk is cheap, now what are we going to do about it? What we, as nation do tomorrow says everything about who we are."
Only on CNN do I see such hate.  What a disgrace you are to the media!
Do not impeach him he deserves to be exile to his friends up in Russia Ì†ºÌ∑∑Ì†ºÌ∑∫
Now the guy in the White House is colluding with the Russians about how to lie about the colluding with the Russians smh
CNN is so biased and opinionated
"Hey 45, did you swallow or spit??!!!
#TRAITORINCHIEF"
Well this is definitely collusion. Lock him Up
Trump threw us under the bus.  He must owe Putin a fortune.
ITS OFFICIAL!! OUR SO CALLED PRESIDENT IS A TRAITOR!! HE JUST MET WITH PUTIN ON WORLD Ì†ºÌºé WIDE TV!! AND OH YES ITS OFFICIAL!! TRUMPF IS A TRAITOR!! WAKE UP AMERICA!! WTF?!!Ì†ΩÌ∏ñÌ†ΩÌ∏§Ì†ΩÌ∏ñ
the Wh website has been changed and is now in Russian
"Trump Looks like BIG BIRD (sesamee str.), but the bad part is HE ACTS LIKE BENEDICT  ARNOLD !!!!!"
"t is clear Trump is owned by Russian Oligarchs and managed by the GRU.

They purchased him via multiple loans to his failed businesses and money laundering endeavors with the Russian mob over the last 10+ years.

There are multiple well sourced articles that detail this in the
Financial Times, New Yorker, and Forbes

Putin is his master -- Period.

The Russian Oligarchs have made inroads into part of the Republican party. The Oligarchs came with big donations and purchased members of the Republican party just like the American Chamber of Commerce has done for decades. Remember those Republican Senators that just got back from a ""A"" kissing fest in Moscow.

Trump is a traitor.

The Republicans Congressmen and Senators that are protecting Trump are also traitors as they are trying to deflect from and obscure an act of treason in progress. Deflecting from an active on-going attack on our country.

Now Trump and Putin are meeting in private. I can only assume they are finalizing another attack plan on our Democracy. As there will be no ""honest brokers"" present exactly what they talk about cannot be verified. We know Putin is a master spy and will lie strategically, and Trump is a morally broken sociopath that lies with almost every sentence he utters and tweet he types.  Let's add to this him taking the side of our enemy rather than protecting our Country and our Constitution.

How can you Republicans support this?????"
"Talk, talk, talk. That is all I am hearing. President Trump is not being impeached,  he is still the president.  I am voting blue in November hoping for a Democrat Congress in 2019 that would really bring impeachment proceedings toward President Trump."
Sad we as American citizens have to endure the shameful behavior of President Trump.
Trump bank account must be full of Russian $s
Agreed. Even Fox agrees. Put 45 in irons and lock him away!
"Anderson Cooper is definitely a disgrace, but I digress"
I just want to know what Putin has on the #AmericanIdiot.
"Not ""one of"" -- THE most disgraceful. Downright treasonous."
Simply more proof that there is a pee pee tape
Is there such a thing as brain spurs?
hunters have found a lot of witches
I Wonder How Fox Ì†æÌ∂äNews Will Spin This One?Ì†ΩÌ∏π
"Love Anderson, always right on!"
TRAITOR....TREASON!....PUTIN'S PUPPET!
Impeach corrupt Trump now!Ì†ΩÌ∏è
This is not shocking..I think everyone saw this coming...was I surprised ??? NO.  Resign or impeach NOW.
"And that it was, we should be calling for his impeachment."
A very sad day for our country it actually feels like it was just sold to the Russian lover of The Traitor. Unbelievable. I really feel like I attended a funeral. Hope Mueller and all the Republicans will do something to get this fool out of our WH.
He‚Äôs compromised bigly and he‚Äôs putting us all at risk with his stupidity!  Congress stop this Ì†ΩÌ≤© now !
"All presidents get ""in bed"" with the enemy .. period .."
"Anderson, you are correct. This is TREASON!"
"Don't have to, watched the real happening live."
Trumpanzees should start wearing a hammer and sickle on their Chinese made ball caps
"He is NOT Presidential, nor does he deserve that title,  1st of all he doesn't know how to conduct himself professionally.  Presidents don't go making deals with just each other with like him go into a room with another country and say we're in to make a deal there's a lot of other things envolved and a lot of people involved in negotiations he things that he some slick stir that he just going to go in there and hes going to clean all this up and do it the right what hes 9 following the rules he does even follow the protocol because he doesn't understand politics that hes involved in right now he doesn't even understand business he knows how to frog people and he knows how to file bankruptcy once his stuff boches but he doesn't have a clue of who hes dealing with these people kill people  #OutOfHisLeague"
"John McCain said that. Anderson was just quoting, and I completely agree!!!!!!!!"
Who's side is Trump on guys? America? I don't think so.
Ben Here‚Äôs the quote I mentioned earlier.
I agree with Anderson so disgraceful
"In case you missed  this lesson in school, this is treason."
"Thank you, Anderson. Thank you for your courage in calling out this atrocity committed in our name."
"As Michael more said, he should be arrested for treason when air force 1 hits the ground!"
CNN is the enemy within America
God bless you Mr Trump i'm   proud I vote for brave american first president if russia that bad why obama didn't do any things about it instead obama have more flaxibity and obama defende russia for un interference in America election and sold urarnium to russia
Impeach him for Treason!!!
"Incompetent, disgrace and a fool."
‚ÄúDisgraceful‚Äù is high praise for this disaster.
Anderson Cooper. Then you must not have watched Obama's performances.
Because Anderson is an opinion writer. No longer a journalist.  Another Rachel Maddow.
"In the words of Trump, lock him up.   Lock trump up for treason."
So humiliating that Trump is the president
Another drumpt educated illiterate! Russian troll!
What a disgrace to every solider that ever fought and died for democracy. 45 just served the US up.
Did you guys see the semen on trump's chin when they came out together? Gross
"I agree.  However, he's going to get away with it.  People of the US can't stop him. Why?"
"It is you, AC, who is disgraceful!"
.....before PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP ....none of the liders ask any Russian liders  open public questions they was Terrified only when hear the world ...Russia...our President ask the Russian lider to answer to the world ...public...but before the details he asked the European liders why they do business as usual with RUSSIA if they are unshure ...so he didnt tell them how to run they're COUNTRIES our PRESIDENT assured the world that we will take care for our country and will be THERE with any solution if is necessary...very simple...didnt break PEACE...didn't Punish Russia to do business with Anyone that they choose...!!!!
"It was disgraceful and all that were watching know that, yet some will still spew that it is fake news."
"We so messed up in America that 45 will be in office another term, smh."
The press need to start calling him what he is before they‚Äôre no longer able to.
This administration is an embarrassment to our country!
If you want to see disgrace look in the mirror
I wish there was a 'scared' emoji
Every word that comes out of Trump's mouth is lies
I don‚Äôt know why people are shocked...
This reporter has been a Trump hater  from the very beginning..   Nothing he says is reporting fairly. Bias prejudice liars...
"If Muller went to Russia, he would not be coming back to USA."
Who really cares what Anderson Cooper says he's another one that thinks he knows it all and works for  fake new CNN da lol
No truer words have been spoken Anderson.
Alexa.....remind me to watch Saturday Night Live this week.
Vote the Republicans out!
Manchurian Canidate!!!
Did you watch the same press conference that I did?  Apparently not . . .
"Basically, Trump took up the bum without hesitation!  Plain and simple!"
And there's your President.
"so the ""Mar"" in Mar a Lago stands for ""Make America Russian""  ahhhh now I get it"
He REALLY needs to be impeached......He is RUINING US.
$400 million? At least try to lie with a realistic amount!
WHAT! Did Putin just say someone sent $400 million in money from Russia to the United States for Hillary Clintons campaign and never paid taxes and it was illegal?
"CNN was quite ok when it was run by Ted Turner, but that was long ago."
Why is this man still President????
So aren't you worried? Who is going to take charge of this mess and charge trump with treason?
Every day I become more scared for the future of this country.
"I really don't care, Do you?"
Ignorance of the law excuses no one
And what is going to be done about it?  Nothing.
"Trump seems to be a company man,but not for our company ,yeah know ?"
He (Trump) basically threw everyone under the busÌ†æÌ¥¶Ì†ºÌøª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
President Spanky Gropenf√ºhrer‚Ñ¢ ~ POTUS INCOMPETUS‚Ñ¢ ~ ADMINISTRATUS CLUSTERFUCKUS‚Ñ¢ *meep meep!
"I liked when Putin said, ‚Äòwho says we trust each other?‚Äô #dinnertableforone"
So what‚Äôs going to be done about it!!!!!!
Brings to mind HRC's tweet sent immediately before this debacle.
"Dear trump supporters ,you love to call democrats and anyone who doesn't agree with you lefties and commies.
Your president has just fawned over Putin the Russian oligarch.
Trump is a businessman and not a politician so why on earth did you ever think it was going to be a good idea to have a president with no tact and absolutely no diplomacy skills try and negotiate with a former KGB spy.
This press conference was released to the rest of the world who now have even less respect for the POTUS than they did before.
The rest of the world view Putin with some skepticism while maintaining some trade links.
Trump has made the US a laughing stock by acting like a starstruck schoolboy in Putin's presence."
He is a disgrace but so is our congress for not doing their job.
Trump's trolls are in the house and when he finishes you will be homeless!
I bet Anderson cooper would take it in the assfor a cheeseburger
Thank you Anderson for telling the truth: it is disgraceful!
Congratulations America! You've just made another headline newsÌ†ΩÌ±èÌ†ΩÌ±èÌ†ΩÌ±èÌ†ΩÌ∏ÇÌ†ΩÌ∏Ç
Nothing I've seen in the last 3 years lets me believe Anderson Cooper would have a different opinion if it were handled any differently.
I thought he was great and nothing disgusting hooray for our President
What does Ryan and the Republican Congress do with this?  Support treasonous Tweetie or take appropriate action? They have a real dilemma now.
"What a DISCASTING brain does he have, TRAGEDY"
"I commented on CBS‚Äôs page...watching Trump and Putin side by side looks like a 10 year old with big hair handing over the U.S. as a meal to a very astute Python with cold, blue eyes.  Yum!"
"‚ÄúOne off the most disgraceful,‚Äù what others even compare Anderson?"
Nothing that we can do....unless Congress wakes up from a coma Ì†ΩÌ∏•Ì†ΩÌ∏•Ì†ΩÌ∏•
He is absolutely rights. Shameful. Treasonous behavior.
Embarrassing isnt the half of it!smdh
Disgusting and disgraceful!!! Jail the traitor!!!
"After watching ‚Äúthe one whose name we do not speak‚Äù lick putins boots, it is more than obvious that not only is there a pee pee tape, I suspect there‚Äôs a poo poo tape too."
TRUMP HAS NO RESPECTED FOR ONE BUT HIMSELF HE DISRESPECTED THE QUEEN FOR MAKING HER WAIL AND HE DISRESPECTED OUR ALLIES ALL AROUND THE WORLD
I don‚Äôt think FOX State Bews can clean this up!
The manchurian candidate
"Has anyone heard what Stzotk said about POTUS?
Any wonder he questions who‚Äôs telling truth and who isn‚Äôt?"
Omg why don‚Äôt you face the fact that he is our President and stop your whining.
You are so right Anderson.  Keep giving us the correct news.
SO SAD---THE WHOLE WORLD NOW KNOWS BEYOND A DOUBT THAT THE POTUS OF AMERICA IS A TRAITOR!!!!!  HE TOLD EVERYONE ON WORLD WIDE TV----HARD TO BACK OUT OF THAT LIE????
45 IS A TRAITOR TO OUR NATION AND THOSE THAT SUPPORT HIM ALSO. THAT'S THE REAL THREAT.
Trump owes millions to the Russian oligarch and he is owned by them.
Wonder if Trump got his pee tape back?
"Wait, ONE of the...? Really? NOTHING comparable to today‚Äôs shitshow has EVER happened before."
Such a disgrace and treasonous.
AMERICA WAKE UP!! WE ARE BEING RULED BY A TURNCOAT. PLEASE GET THESE PEOPLE OUT OF WASHINGTON!! WE THE PEOPLE NEED TO VOTE AND VOTE BLUE!!
I refuse to watch any of that criminal activity. Glad they are recording it!
Great. How can anyone doubt a nice honest man like my buddy Vlad.
Trump to the world: ‚ÄúGo ahead and meddle in our elections. It‚Äôs our own fault if you do.‚Äù
"Fortunately, Cooper said it so nobody cares."
HOOOOWWWWWW do people still support this cockwomble? HOOOWWWWW do they watch that press conference and fail to see his TREASON? The level of delusion is truly incomprehensible!!
Cooper supports the DNC‚Äôs corruption.
The GOP must do something now. Tell him to step down.
wow - were so proud that you stood for America - Unbelievable
You all should be grateful that CNN can speak the truth Trump cheated and America is no longer a world power not with a person like him at the helm
"the absolute worst... not one of, but the absolute most treacherous"
"TOTALLY CORRECT, HE'S ALWAYS BEEN AN EMBARRESSEMENT"
That this SHOCKS any of us is quite amazing.
TRUMPRAITOR should be locked up!
What was the press conference for? A photo op for Putin! Disgusting and disgraceful!
"Where are you trumpsters? Hiding under a rock no doubt. #DUMP2020, hopefully before."
Utterly disgraceful.  Cowardly...spineless...shall I go on?
There needs to be outrage in this community
We‚Äôre over a year into his presidency and he‚Äôs still using Hillary as his scape goat Ì†ΩÌ∏ÇÌ†ΩÌ∏ÇÌ†ΩÌ∏Ç.
"When the ad starts, I'm done."
I wish I could say I was surprised.
Arrest him when he tough USA ground before he sell USA to Dictators. Sad day
Nothing new here....Trump was just checking in with his boss (the real president of US) Vladimir Putin.
"Heath you are nuts non is true,Trump that SOB lying bustard will be found out by Mueller"
IT WAS INCREDIBLY EMBARRASSING
Disgraceful. The UN needs to step in and call this what it is- treason.
They have 45 in their control. A sad day for our country.
I can't with the trumpsters....Ì†ΩÌ±ÄÌ†ΩÌ±Ä
Couldn't agree more.  Crickets by his GOP shills.  Get the Impeachment papers moving.
And Putin is laughing all the way to the bank!
Let's see if even THIS moves the GOP and congress to do something about that person standing with Putin. What a puppet!!!
Of course he would say that...wouldn‚Äôt matter how it went or what was said!!!  ‚ùÑÔ∏è‚ùÑÔ∏è‚ùÑÔ∏è
"Desde luego que es una enorme verg√ºenza.
Dos psic√≥patas hablan, uno listo y el naranja tonto.
Pobre USA , pobre mundo....."
"And the President calling out about the SERVER, WHERE IS THAT SERVER, ridiculous!!!"
"So it looks like Americans need to learn Russian, or at least his Trumpets do Ì†ºÌ∑∫Ì†ºÌ∑∏Ì†ΩÌ∏éÌ†ºÌ∑∫Ì†ºÌ∑∏Ì†ΩÌ∏é"
Guess Trump' supporters and Republicans in Congress are Proud.  When will TRUMP Make America Great Again.
DON THE CON IMPEACH NOW!!
Shout it loud and clear!
Can you imagine the outrage if Obama had behaved this way. Can't wait til mueller takes him down
Congrats Republicans we were sold out by your party. This will be your legacy.
"(Y) Cooper's report, Ì†ΩÌ∏° with Trump, and Ì†ΩÌ∏ü for democracy and our country."
"So remember, remember the 6th of November...
FRY THEM."
Trump stood there with his TAIL BETWEEN HIS LEGS !
They still going to get 45 it‚Äôs a long ways from being over ever been over for himÌ†ΩÌπèÌ†ºÌøΩÌ†ΩÌ∞¨
A sad day for our Nation.
"Read the story not the comments. Too many trolls here, don‚Äôt feed them."
We elect a narcissist and then expect him to act on our behalf?
"Good assessment. This Pres is an enigma. Says one thing, does another."
Remove secret service protection immediately!
keep trying for peace on earth...
I still don‚Äôt understand why he went over there.
"Snobby liberals like you Anderson Cooper won't be happy until there is a nuclear war. Since the 1950's people like you have been pushing for a war with Russia. I pray that you never get your way with your ""better than thou"" snobbish attitude."
Melania is wearing YELLOW...Ì†æÌ¥£BwahahahaÌ†ΩÌ∏Ç
He is indeed!  Not a reporter at all and couldn‚Äôt recognize truth if it hit him in the face.  #@andersoncooperisanidiot
Haters keep on hat in‚Äô . Trump loves America and is brave enough to do something about!
Thank you Anderson for speaking the truth!
There is a traitor among us and he is holding the highest office of the land.
"Now you know that Fox will say what a great job by the president.  He brought up the issue and accepted that great guy, Putin‚Äôs denial.  Fox will probably say the president is right to lift up Russia and diss our Intelligence officials and the Democratic Party.   After all everybody but them is fake news!"
So embarrassing!!! Impeach! Get him out of there. Traitor!
"I don't know whether to ""heart"" this, ""frown"" it or ""cry"" it."
"I don‚Äôt care about his opinion. Am I supposed to believe he has an ounce of intellectual honesty at this point? This is what happens when you criticize every single thing, all the time, no matter what. Your words become worthless."
It really was disgraceful. Country before Party everyday. This was very damaging to America.
I am having a hard time understanding what happened here???
His cult will still defend him.  Unbelievable!!!!
TRUMP  IS  MAKING  OLD  WHITE  AMERICA  LOOK        like  the  reaql  america
Who cares what Cooper thinks
Listen to this Trumpeters.
Given what the intelligence community and Hillary and her cronies have done what did you expect?
"Nice to see comments and reports on something that nobody seen.
Or did they broadcast the meeting?"
BEST PRESIDENT EVER. GET OVER IT WON FAIR & SQUARE. COOPER THE POOPER
Please save us from this incompetent idiot.
Remember when O had meetings with Putin
He's dismissing our intelligecy agency because he knows they are about to take him down.
Disgraceful?!?!???? SMART...PRODUCE THE EMAILS AND SERVERS...STOP THE CRAP!
"Even when  the video shows exactly what happens, the trolls call it fake news. How dumb can you get?"
"Even better, he kept calling Trump Rain Man."
Worse than any of us have ever seen Mr. Anderson.
Who cares what he thinks
I agree the whole world is laughing at us
one of the most? I wasn't counting but nothing can top this unless he fights impeachment.
"Treason, and should be treated as such! Lock him up!"
And they're surprised??!! Ì†æÌ¥£ what on earth were they expecting?
"Had it been Hillary, Anderson would‚Äôve felt happy Ì†æÌ¥£Ì†ΩÌ∏Ç"
if Obama was doing it it would be the greatest thing ever
TREASON!!! President Reagan must be spinning in his grave.
I have no respect for anything coming from this network...
"World cup latest
Russia 1 usa 0
Trump o.g."
Putin has as much respect for trump as fisherman have for the leech they are using as bait.
I wonder how Faux News is spinning this charade ?
Can we borrow the big ballon from London?
I thought it was awesome!
That LAST question posed to Putin....I saw anger in his face when IT was asked.  He lied!!!!!!
How can people still support this bought bozo?
What was the over/ under on the headline? Think I hit big!
"Name another one because ‚Äúone of the most‚Äù implies there are others. I don‚Äôt think so Silver Fox, don‚Äôt think so"
So is this his shooting someone on 5th ave moment?
Now we know how Melania felt 9 months before Baron was born!
This really is scary stuff.
"All these trolls on here spewing hate lies, alternative facts."
i feel we have a constitutional crisis....
Notice he didn't walk in front of Putin or shove him out of the way???????????
"You're absolutely right, Anderson!"
"I WASN'T voting for a choir boy, knew that going in.

I WASN'T voting for a pastor or rabbi, knew then as now that he's a flawed individual.

I WAS voting against someone whom I believed to be a fundamentally corrupt individual.

I WAS voting against someone who had promised a continuation of 8 years of a policy agenda that, in my opinion, did tremendous harm to the nation I love. Some of it irreversible. 

I WAS voting for a non-politician. I've seen the results politicians are capable of producing and, frankly, I'm not impressed.

I WAS voting for someone who's a bit of a jerk. Knew that going in too.  Also frankly, after 8 years of 'marshmallow' I thought we needed a bit of 'bully', particularly as it relates to foreign policy.

I WAS voting for someone who understood the common sense position that a nation needs to and has a right to control it's own borders for it's own citizens protection and who won't bow to the pressure of political correctness in his statements or policy direction for getting it done. 

Speaking of political correctness,  I WAS voting for someone who is not afraid to speak the obvious - that radical islamic jihadists are real, are dangerous and must be annihilated. 

I WAS voting for a businessman, accustomed to complex negotiations who understands America is being taken advantage of in a massive kind of way and who has the stones to stare foreign leaders in the eye, tell them as much & say, ""Those days are over. Clean it up, make it fair, or the United States is outta here."" And mean it.  

I also knew going in that the 45th president would likey have multiple Supreme Court appointments so I WAS voting for someone I felt would seat strict constitutional jurists on the Court, not agents of 'social change' or 'social justice'  who would rule based on personal preference or bias rather than constitutional interpretation. 

I WAS voting for all these things and guess what? I got them.

-Derrick Wilburn"
This traitor is shameless!
What could possibly the argument against impeachment now?
It‚Äôs treasonous! What happened to Country first?
Not one of the most disgraceful. It is THE MOST DISGRACEFUL and treasonous
As a Brit looking on from afar I witness a great country shooting itself in both feet.
I think Trump cannot trust his own FBI.
And to think this man will be written about in history books.
Try being an honest journalist Cooper...
One man blowing another one. Im sure Anderson can fellate...err relate.
"Don't come back, Donnie Anagram
GUMMIER SCAT FLUIDS
""Disgraceful Summit"""
I had to turn it off as it was so embarrassing .
Trump will be in prison in less than three years.
Who cares what you think?
It's starting to unravel......
What a disgrace to America this man!
This should worry us all
You'll voted this fool into office.
Please concerned Republicans vote blue to get Putin out of our Government
In one word TREASON!!!!!!!!!!
Did anyone really expect better?  How many passes will iq45 receive from a congress that sits on their thumbs?  Silence is deadly.  It is time to vote out every complicit and enabling congress person.
Wow still defending this disgrace
Was Jim Acosta's nose bleeding?   That crazy summit must have given him a brain bleed.
It would be great to hear the news instead of the opinions of those who don't do anything useful.
The mouth is attached to the brain...no organ.
He will never do anything against sugar daddy putin
You are so correct Anderson. A disgrace.  The world is watching.
"Performance? What is this, a Broadway show?"
"Anderson is correct.  t-Rump is a traitor, through and through!"
I am sure he has seen worst situations just by watching his own program.
Should I learn the Russian language?  Wow.
Ed Bruce well I have missed a lot today Ì†ΩÌ∏´
Where is our Republican leadership??
Anderson I agree wholeheartedly with you.  What can we do to get Congress & the Republican Party to wake up?
he walked behind Putin..lol
WHAT. A. MESS!  AND will we just stand by and watch this non-sense to completely unfold?
"Yes, yes he would. I wouldn't have expected anything different. That's CNN."
"Spot on Anderson. This ""president"" is a disgrace."
You misspelled OBAMA AHAHAHAHAH
I agree ac he is a freaking coward ‚Ä¶.no back bone and putin laughed out loud at him
"Thank you for seeing that as well Mr. Cooper. This was disgraceful and cowardly. How in the world would he take the side of Putin over his own people ( FBI), that's a disgrace!"
Anyone really think it would go any other way
amen to that anderson and keep up the good work that you do
Trump is defenently the bottom man in this relationship
He is such an embarrassment to our country
Trump did everything but kiss Putin
I just want to know when Molly Hatchet is going to drop a new album.
Hope do we get rid of this moron??
Liberals still can't get over the fact they lost. Russia had nothing to do with trump getting elected. Hillary being a treasonous c*nt is what what got trump elected.
I call him one of the most disgraceful commentators on TV.
And with the no ball Congress or Senate  we are screwed
CNN trying to cause trouble like Russia did! Face Book check & balances for their reports. CNN must be in collusion with Russia & the democrats!!!!
I agree with you 100% Anderson is a disgrace to the US.

Well he didn't whisper in his ear like the last President
Treason in front of the world to see.
Remarkable the number of bots responding to this story!
Moments like these when I wish I spent my life as a Doomsday prepper.
"Cooper, you are 100% right!  It was a disgrace!  Impeachment needed."
imaginese usted un burro frente a una liebre quien sale con la mejor tajada
TRAITOR!!!  He should be arrested as soon as he steps foot back in this country.
Treason carries the most serious penalty. Trump is too deep to pull out. He is owned. Chased the dollar lost his soul
Donald T-rump is a Russian Collaborator.
"Huston we have a problem , we have a runaway president help  Mr Anderson help"
"We should not be surprised any more.

What would Regan say if he were alive nowÌ†æÌ¥Ø"
Am i the only one that noticed his bleeding nose at the end ????? Lol
"Come on people wake the hell up. CNN only reports half of the story that advances their anti- trump agenda. 

Get some information from non-traditional media and then make up your own mind. Anyone reading this garbage and then believing it is naive at best."
Shame on those who didn‚Äôt vote last elections
It was hard to watch. His trip has been chaotic at all levels.
"Charge him and his accomplices with treason, , ,"
Agreed! Reason to impeach!!! Amongst all the others!
"We need a true American, 
A knowledgeable, and coherent leader,
Not an ignorant clown......."
"Hmmm, but kneeling during the anthem is unpatriotic. GotchaÌ†æÌ¥î"
Listening to his speech was similar to hearing a child reading from their first grade reader.
So sad the way he spoke of his country he is the president what will he do next OMG !
Lock trump up and  his whole family and please not to forget fox and friends !!
Really don't care what Anderson thinks!!!
"Lol, it‚Äôs the only he has actually been at!"
Someone should ask the president if enjoyed the taste of comrade Putin‚Äôs testicles.
"And the Republicans just stay silent,  he s destroying our country"
His greatest achievement in his presidency so far has been being a consistent embarrassment.
"Good for you, you are so rite, you are the best, thanks"
* Okay Anderson why don't you go and interview Putin.. See if you will turn Red for a change......
"when two geniuses meet, you will always get a genius."
"Hillary and Obama warned
‚Äú he is unfit‚Äù."
A slap in the face to everyone!
Call it what it is -- TREASON!!!!!!
He is totally out of control Omg for real

How horrible for the arms business if there were better relations with the largest and second largest military arms dealers. Perhaps that money could go to improving life instead of promoting death.

"But it was so funny and entertained
Lol"
TRUMP WILL NEVER BE A DICTATOR IN THIS COUNTRY
45 needs to go!! He is destroying this country!!
#TreasonSummit on Twitter is trending big time
"What is Putin holding over Trump's head, other than the pee pee tape, that would cause Trump to believe Putin's word that he did nothing instead of trusting all the US Intelligence agencies who have found proof that Russia interferred with the election?"
"Trump a Russian tool, an American dotard."
"El homosexual hablando de falta de valent√≠a del presidente Trump,que ir√≥nico Cooper."
Oh my geez-us..... move on already ! How is Hillary NOT being held responsible for her missing emails ??
The orange fungus just got done getting done with no vaseline in front of the entire world.
I hope the people that didn‚Äôt vote last time I learned their lesson. If you want to those don‚Äôt gripe
rump went against our justice system
Maybe trump thought he was at his campaign Rally ?
And The GOP let Trump be the nominee?
The traitor #45 must go!
"When he comes back to America, put the cuffs on and take him wherever."
Shameful behavior by a corrupt ‚Äúleader‚Äù
I hope everyone upset remembers to VOTE August 7th 2018 and in the Midterms in November!
It is a sad day for all Americans
"We are not tax paying Americans for this kind of insane, frightening and downright evil behavior."
"Treason is what it is!!!   More than disgraceful.  Trump has sided with the enemy!  Anyone read the constitution???  

18 U.S. Code ¬ß 2381 - Treason

Whoever, owing allegiance to the United States, levies war against them or adheres to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort within the United States or elsewhere, is guilty of treason and shall suffer death, or shall be imprisoned not less than five years and fined under this title but not less than $10,000; and shall be incapable of holding any office under the United States"
Lock the doors and throw the keys
Who don't you just get rid of him
"So why,why do WE keep this Evil,Evil,Evil person in Office..
It's obvious he cares for this Thug....this is why I avoid Trump in his 15 minutes of fame..this is scary,too scary!
I HAVE A RIGHT TO MY OPTION n NEGATIVE REMARDS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU CAN DO WITH YOURS!!"
This was so difficult to watch Ì†ΩÌ∏ÇÌ†æÌ¥£Ì†ΩÌ∏ÇÌ†æÌ¥£
Just a thought Hope they check the soccer ball for any listening devices   Just saying
"Just waiting for rock bottom. I don‚Äôt think we are there yet, sadly..."
Omg....somebody needs to help the people of the U.S. This is not a joke...horrific.
Thus was just awful. How can he be this dumb..
What do you mean one of the worst? What was worse?
Even the dead Soviet Union General Secretaries turn in their mausoleums.
The truth is NOW out wake up American peolpe!  USAjoke
Vote blue get this traitor out of office
Impeachable offense done right in public. God knows what we didn‚Äôt see and hear‚Äîyet.
The  world is horrified  God help America
I honestly believe Trump is a KGB agent by his actions and words !
Two dictators made out behind the closed door with the expense of tax payers money Ì†ΩÌ≤∞! Wasted!
"Thanks, Anderson! Refreshing objectivity!"
Just think Donnie got a new ball.
Sad days.  I am at a loss although I should have expected it from the trumpster fire
Omg stop people. Live in the here & now not the past. Let it go already.
Who cares what Anderson  dodo thinks?
His time is  coming Republican party is going
"absolutely shameful, Treason?"
We all know that.. he is a macro shame.
we have a winner for the cold war!
Some day we‚Äôll know what Putin has on him
"We believe what we want to still, don‚Äôt we?! Pitiful"
It's time for the GOP to stand up to this traitor.
I'm not gone say I'm Surprise because I'm not.  Hillary called this before it happened  smh!!
"There's more to it than being put out, said."
You would think that a person with soooo much money and soooo intelligent (per Trumps comments). that he would enroll in a class of public speaking. All we see when he is giving his reports is the top of his head as he reads what someone else had written
"Mr. Cooper you got it all wrong, you are the one who is a disgrace and working for a company who puts out FAKE NEWS!"
"Democrats lost, get over it."
Very disgusting this is home grown traitor
TRAITOR IN CHIEF . . . WHERE DO OUR REPUBLICAN CITIZENS DRAW THE LINE?

How cares about your opinion Anderson. Look it your self in a mirror and talk about that
We need to take to the streets in protest just like the citizens of England and Scotland did last week. Why are we putting up with this???
We should all be saying kaddish for our countryÌ†ΩÌ∏¢
Not even a nice try mister...
Hillary did not commit treason. Trump did n still doing it
Totally agree. I'm from Scotland and I despair for America having that dangerous buffoon in charge
Such a disgrace hahah what a joke
It sounds to me less like incompetence and more like treason.
"Why does that last speakers nose start to bleed, did u see that Flavio ?"
Haha no kidding!  Maybe Melania‚Äôs shoes?
"I wasn't there, but knowing Trump I agree 100%!"
"Brad Smith, can you believe this?? He is going to make us the next USSR!"
"Week after week since he was ""elected"", trump never has failed to disappoint. Winning?Ì†ΩÌ∏è"
Ronald Reagan is rolling in his grave.
"Gonna say......is that news, or personal opinion?"
"Hey Anderson, grow up this is the real world, not your fake crap....."
"They certainly should, but won‚Äôt .... don‚Äôt poke the giant ahole
Don"
He does not believe in his own Justice department
But still hurts Anderson?
He abased himself before the world.
"Really Anderson, guess you haven't seen much!"
What an embarrassment besides other things!
Now what Trump supporters pretty hard to support this disgrace???
Who cares what he says anyway.
I thought they were going to kiss each other.
"Sen Corker is out of his nogging to say we want a better relationship with Russia. He stands by that name of his ""Corker"". That's exactly what he is a corker!"
It's the ONLY ONE YOUVE EVER SEEN.
Coming from a pussy I‚Äôd expect nothing different from Anderson.
When will enough be enough to get him out.  It‚Äôs beyond treasonous Ì†ΩÌ∏°
Lots of Russian troll bots on this thread. Just report them as spam and block them.
God help us. President against his own people. Defending a criminal..
One of the most....?  Who had a more disgraceful performance?
This is the funniest thing I heard all dayÌ†ΩÌ∏Ç  FAKE NEWS!
"Derechitooo el hijo de la chingada , hasta el paso le da Liliana Monroy"
This is the day that removed all doubt.
Time to form units people! Let's go traitor hunting!
"After what I just read and heard happened earlier today in Helsinki, Donald Trump's entire government needs to be TOPPLED by ever citizen in this country taking to the streets in in vocal protest..... His entire administration has to be TOPPLED with the exception of the Justice Department and the FBI!!!  ENOUGH IS ENOUGH.  We can no longer go about our lives as if it doesn't matter and we'll get through it.  We WON'T!

HIS PRESIDENCY MUST BE DESTROYED AT ALL COSTS!  Mueller has got to hurry now!!! Law enforcement must storm his office, arrest him, handcuff him in chains and leg irons, lead away to a 24 hour a day harsh labor camp while he awaits trial, then convict him a followed by suffering the strongest penalties for treason against the government and citizens of the United States of America!

James Fallows of the Atlantic Magazine is one of the most intelligent and respected writers of our time.  His article in the Magazine should now blow everyone's mind.  Every republican who still is ok with all of this, which is 85%, needs to be vaporized!!!

Not even Rod Serling wrote a Twilight Zone episode so frightening.  Stephen King couldn't even write anything this horrific.

------------------------------

""There are exactly two possible explanations for the shameful performance the world witnessed on Monday, from a serving American president.

Either Donald Trump is flat-out an agent of Russian interests‚Äîwitting, unwitting, from fear of blackmail, in hope of future deals, out of manly respect for Vladimir Putin, out of gratitude for Russia's help during the election, out of pathetic inability to see beyond his 306 electoral votes‚Äîwhatever the exact mixture of motives might be, it doesn't really matter.

Or he is so profoundly ignorant, insecure, and narcissistic not to realize that, at every step, he was advancing the line that Putin hoped he would advance, and the line that the American intelligence, defense, and law-enforcement agencies most dreaded. 

Conscious tool. Useful idiot. Those are the choices, though both possibly true‚Äîthe main question is the proportions.

Whatever the balance of motivations, what mattered was that Trump's answers were indistinguishable from Putin's, starting with the fundamental claim that Putin's assurances about interference in U.S. democracy (‚Äúhe was incredibly strong and confident in his denial‚Äù) deserved belief over those of his own Department of Justice (‚ÄúI think the probe is a disaster for our country‚Äù).

I am old enough to remember Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon telling lies on TV, about Vietnam (in both cases) and Watergate for Nixon. I remember the travails and deceptions of Bill Clinton, and of George W. Bush in the buildup to the disastrous Iraq war. 
But never before have I seen an American president consistently, repeatedly, publicly, and shockingly advance the interests of another country over those of his own government and people.
Trump himself manifestly cannot help himself. This is who he is."""
boy the Democrat idiots are alive today thinking they won a horsey at the carnival.
This all happened under the Obama administration
"Well, he is making America great again."
And I thought mexico had it bad.

"I knew he was a traitor, self centered, liaying crook"
To side with Putin is mind boggling to say the least......
"Fact check. Everything you stated is not true.  Fact check reliable sources, not FOX."
"Of course he was a disgrace, he's a disgrace as a human being."
Let's end this we're  all sick of this.Get it over do something.

The Big Big Bully turns out to be a Totally Lame Sissy in front of the whole world

I hate treasonous behavior of any type of persuasion
After tossing a soccer ball our first ladyÌ†æÌ¥îÌ†æÌ¥îÌ†æÌ¥î priceless moments.
What about the Dems and their rigging in the election
"No surprise there, just disgraceful!"
Comrade Trumpski won‚Äôt separate Russian interference from alleged collusion because it delegitimizes his election.
Who cares what this hack says?
Coming from the worst reporter of all time fake news sources it‚Äôs an honor to call President Donald Trump my hero
"So sad! Sad, Sad, Sad day for America! ' I do care don't You?"""
Let the liberal head explosions begin!!! I remember the same reaction to Reagan with Gorbachev. Look what happened there. So happy to have this President over Clinton.
"I'd say suck a bag of dicks, butt...."
His minions should be very proud.
"I can't for his supporters to realize how much he's been peeing on them.

What is one to do. It‚Äôll take years to undo and cleanup the damage trump has done to the United States. WAKE UP AMERICA
working hard to start a civil war and a world war i see
"Why are you so surprised by Trump inaction, duh..???"
I missed the conference..what happened?
Can‚Äôt believe how far the left is willing to go.
"Anderson, it‚Äôs exactly what you should have expected."
Interference sound better than meddling as if to minimize Russian involvement
He is a dictator. Nothing good can come of this president Sad
How many proof do you need. Wake up people! He is a menace to democracy. #Lock him up ! And 45 should release his taxes.
Can't help but feel T. is a Traitor to our country.
"Don‚Äôt worry guys, next week everyone will have a new witch hunt to pursue."
If you don't know the truth by now.You need Help
He must have other interest...He must be impeach for this!
Well I dont care about Anderson's opinion.
"Anderson Crapper is a nobody, Fox New's Chris Wallace gets the interview with Vladimir Putin, Cooper intervirews the toilet bowl"
Trump just let the flag touch the ground.
I was disappointed to he should have taken a reset button. That always works
Ok trumpers you better and start learning speak Russian!
I can't believe any of this crap is really happening Ì†æÌ¥ØÌ†æÌ¥ØÌ†æÌ¥ØÌ†æÌ¥¨
"gee  mr , cooper  thats how i think  of you  an american  disgrace"
"Today it felt like America has capitulated to Russia, what an embarrassment"
"Cooper,,,don,T you have some where to. go like

I don't care what you think. You are CNN..

I knew it was going to be terrible this man is dumb as hell
Of course! would  not expect anything else from the news!
Yea someone not calling accusations without physical evidence against a country is a disgrace... just like the Iraq war? How about you pick a side buddy
Where is a good assassin when you need one.
Keep up with your great fast food diet and do us all a favor...
"I support Anderson, trumpanze is a constant embarrassment.  Now he‚Äôs in Putin‚Äôs pocket."
So much for America first! He just threw us under the bus and told the entire world not to trust us!
Of course he wouldn‚Äôt believe it because it would only incriminate himself. What a piece of work.
The Russian have something on the president
"You have to ask yourself... Who's side are you on Mr. President??? What a embarrassing, disgraceful man."
If anyone should know a disgraceful act; it would be Anderson.
#deplorable #notfitforpotus  SLAP handuffs on this POS when he gets off the plane!
Seriously? Anderson pooper is the original tea bagger!
Was his nose starting to bleed there at the end or was the just the video?
"i watched some of cnn today,  those people are idiots"
Anderson ... I could not have said it better myself..
And America upset about kneelingÌ†ºÌ∑∫Ì†ºÌ∑∏..but this is ok!!??
My heart is crying today more than ever after what Trump is helping Putin and putting down our very own his government!!!!!!  Never in my life have ever seen this shame!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Why should that surprise anybody, according to the democrats, he has never done anything right!"
I guess this is why they are in 17th place behind home and garden tv
The worst president ever so what do u expect
Why is trump disgraceful for this I don‚Äôt understand  what did he do wrong
If u can‚Äôt see now that trump is selling us out there is something really wrong with u
So true...absolutely disgusting.
Grumpy Cat could defend our country better than this turd lump
He puts us all in deeper and deeper trouble every day.
"Cooper, just shut the hell up!"
Of course he does lmao Ì†ΩÌπÑ
we don't care what you think or how you spin things
What are those black marks that start appearing on Acosta‚Äôs face towards the end of the vid?? Creepy.
"open corruption, and the GOP republicans continue to prop him up."
This network is a disgrace to American Dream
But yet has still the President! How long will this go on?!?! Ì†æÌ¥¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
It was disgraceful. How can his supporters be happy about thisÌ†ΩÌ∏¢Ì†ΩÌ∏¢
Dear Hillary please run again you‚Äôd win in a fair and honest election
Treason.  Nothing else covers this scenario.  Trump must be impeached!
Hey A.C. most of us have  been saying that about the job you jokers have been doing for over 3 years. You have a lot of bloody nerve you 3 and a have point idiot

Ronald Reagan is spinning in his grave today.
"Dear American voters, I hope today was a wake up call! How much more does it take?

Russian troups on American soil and Trump calling it a parade?

While the scenario of Russian troups in America is not a possibility Trump calling an invasion a parade  is unfortunately VERY possible!

After what happened today there is no doubt...

Wake up, America! Stop the destruction of all this nation was founded on!"
Agreed 100 percent! I'm flabbergasted  and even more repulsed by him than I already was
Just when you thought it couldn‚Äôt get any worse!
too bad enough people buy his bs.
So are we still investigating Russian/trump collusion?
"he wants to be a dick tator just like pukin is, does he have to shout it, all the signs are there"
We have a disgraceful and treasonous President we must insist congress do their jobs and start impeachment hearings
Trying to care what AC thinks
LMBO! I love it? Trump is right he won that election on his own. It was Hillary who stole the democratic primary from Bernie. She along with Obama were the ones colluding with Russia not just in 2016 but for years.
"‚ÄúThere has been no shortage of historic summits in American history - but nothing like what is happening today. No American president has ever appeared as a supplicant to a foreign power who attacked us - an attack that the intelligence community says is ongoing. No American president has been so eager to placate a hostile foreign power. And no American president has been under a credible shadow of allegedly conspiring with a hostile foreign power. No American president has so attacked our allies and heaped scorn on his fellow citizens while heaping praise on a hostile foreign power. No American president has been so ill-prepared for diplomacy and statecraft and then insisted on handling negotiations with a hostile foreign power alone. We do not know what was discussed. We will not be able to trust what President Trump or Putin say was discussed. Their words fail even the most minimum standards of political truth telling. This is a historic summit indeed, but historic in terms of the damage it can do (and likely already has done) to our nation and a democratic world order. ‚Äú         Dan Rather"
Someone should sew that idiots mouth shut!
"I so agree.  Trump is almost treasonous.  Poor excuse for a human being,  never mind a President."
"Nothing new, fake news media just bushing and resist!"
AUnderderson Cooper...how dare you...you shamed the LGBT community...
That goes double for me!
Anderson you need to shut your pie hole.
What a horribly traiterous man ..not a president but a coward
Of course he does. Did anyone expect anything else?
And CNN  and DUMMYCRATS  have their daily MELTDOWN.
At least trump didn‚Äôt give out in a toys r us gift that said overcharge and then the Russians started to laugh at her
"Health Stinson

What are your sources?
So you think Trump and his billionaire cronies speak for you? Do you expect them to change the system that made them rich?
They‚Äôre using you and others to push their agenda. This is only a distraction to make sure that the important issues aren‚Äôt addressed. This the same as being a seal and cheering for the shark!Ì†æÌ¥£"
Time for you to go away. Nobody cares about what you think!
Anderson Copper is a blank slate. He shouldn't be allowed to be on tv.
And this is the leader of the Free world.......
The level of ignorance in these posts breaks my heart
What do people expect from Trump he wants to be like Putin it‚Äôs his dream.
Wish we could believe a word CNN says
Its hot and humid out today
He knew he wouldn‚Äôt win without Putin‚Äôs help so can‚Äôt say nothing bad about Putin
@Facebook   Really don‚Äôt like the new ads in the middle of a video.  Overkill
There are no words how incompetent he is. Got to get this jerk out of office. He is one sick puppy!!!
At the end of the video what was coming out of his nose  black  and lies coming out of his nose lol
This is what a fake presidency looks like.
"Anderson is the best, classiest journalists there is.  Have no right to  put him down."
"When will he present the deed to Putin since he has presented him the ""key."""
Does Trump ever button his jacket - so sloppy.  Too many quarter pounders I guess.
Really Anderson? Who the hell do you think you are???Ì†æÌ¥îÌ†æÌ¥îÌ†æÌ¥îfake news!!!!!!!
That's nothing. Some idiot found $1500 on the street near Kmart today. He tried to give it to a police officer but the officer thought it was a prank and wouldn't accept it. So this idiot bought himself a phone and groceries out of the store with the money. This is where it gets hilarious. The idiot kept tapping on ...... See More
"I admire Anderson Cooper more than ANYONE in Trump's circle of liars, traitors and losers."
"And so far, only a handful of Republicans have expressed disapproval."
What has changes. Words were spoke by our President and Russia's President. If no deal was made theres nothing different than yesterday so stop coming unglued.

Anderson Cooper your a disgrace to yourself LOL.
Really digusting the whole world know this.
"Anderson...Matthew 7:1 ""Do not judge, or you too will be judged."
Doesn‚Äôt this guy hide the popsicle where the sun don‚Äôt shine?
Even Faux News actually reported it...maybe the dumpanzees will finally get it...this guy is a FRAUD.
Democrats got everything totally twisted. To be honest they really know nothing about what Trump and Putin talked about. So get over it that Hillary lost the election and that Trump will be reelected in 2024.
So was he there behind closed doors with Trump and Putin?
I thought it was a great press conference....I think the left wanted him to bow...lol
TROLLS ARE VERY VERY BUSY TODAY! The words of their leader said it all today! T RUMP IS A TRAITOR AND SHOULD BE IMPEACHED NOW!
I love Trump meeting with putin it was right on topic
Trump looks always cool and relax.

Wrong it‚Äôs was classic awesome Ì†ΩÌ∏é!!!!!
What Putin were supposed to say? It was Super Tramp who was the one who should aggressively asked about Russia role in US election. Putin was just having fun RC controlling his puppet.
it'll all come back to haunt Trump.  100%.
We never thought it would be anything but.
Did Trump thank Putin for rigging the Election so he could win.

do you remember hearing about official bussiness being on a private Clinton server? hmm
I can‚Äôt read this blog! It‚Äôs ridiculous!
Where are Ryan and Mitch? sure would love to hear what they have to say...another pad on the hand and let's move on...When is this enough...we just handed over our country to a KGB
John Mallon Duncan Taylor we must have war now...like right now.  This is not on...this peace stuff.
"He got his new set of marching orders from Putin today, then read the Putin prepared speech."
STILL LOVING MY PRES. Donald J. Trump!!!!!
Anderson you are absolutely correct on this one. Traitor Trump!!
That has to be the end of him doesn‚Äôt it?
hahaha CNN.. Peace and cooperation beats nuclear annihilation.
"Unbelievable, our so called president sold us out!"
"you are all corrupt. democrats, republicans, the media, fbi, cia, ect. if the fbi and cia was not corrupt, there would be no swamp. there would be a bunch of politicians in jail. term limits needed for congress/house of reps."
And the trump cult will continue to defend him no matter what he says or does.  It's truly repulsive.
Those who still support Trump are spitting on the graves of veterans.
"Those who could do something are the 51 Republican senators, and 236 Republican representatives who have a sworn DUTY to protect this country against enemies both foreign and domestic.

"Of course, Mr know it all, would NOT agree..He probably would disagree when Trump says ...HELLO.."
An American president just sided with Russia over the United States. Unbelievable.
As if his opinion means anything except to other Trump haters.
NO NEED TO ADD WORDS!!! AS ALL OF US KNOWS!!!
Unprecedented. A sitting president refusing to accept his own security agency‚Äôs finding.
This happened under Obama---where were you then Cooper??? Obama did nothing !!  Now you want Trump to clean up the mess! We spy-they spy the whole dam world spies!
I‚Äôd love to secretly swap out Anderson‚Äôs SPF 70  for baby oil
Boy! on this feed there really is not much intelligence on display!
"He‚Äôs not our President, he‚Äôs owned by Putin."
"Anything short of President Trump putting Putin in a headlock, and giving him a couple of good noogie noogies, just would NOT have satisfied Americas crazed press, CNN leading the way. CNN IS WHAT‚ÄôS WRONG WITH THIS COUNTRY!!!"
"Trump, the boss, the President building relationships and eradicating terrorist all over the world"
"Putin told the American press and Mueller to put up, or shut up!  So, what's it going to be??"
Freeloaders and socialist democrats comment alot with NO proof. Hahaha
Disgraceful ... an absolute cowardly idiot ... this imbecile has no backbone Ì†æÌ¥¢Ì†æÌ¥Æ
This is a day that makes me embarrassed to be an American who has this petulant child as a ‚Äúso called leader‚Äù. He‚Äôs done ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to unite this country & this is indicative of even further divide! The time has come for his pathetic GOP cronies to wake up and join forces with the democrats and get him out before it‚Äôs too late!
"Of all these pundits, professional & armchair, who can say what is in Trumps mind? Do you know for sure if he does/ doesn‚Äôt have a strategy?
If you do have empirical evidence to validate your claims.... please cite."
"Everyone knew his move, but prolly expect him 2 use it? He ""played"" or is playing his Ì†ºÌæÆ. The media & the rest IS playing catch & match, or least tryn 2. Y'all can ‚úã him if really want. But the ""Ì†ºÌæÆ"" IS frustrating @ times, but still ""enjoyable"" 2 some."
For the Love of God and everything that's holy! This man child needs to be impeached!!
He should ask puttin for asylum & build his trump tower Moscow & move in
Even Fox News is starting to hedge their bets on Trump.
"Have some respect for your President, even if you don't like him."
As bad as everything you say just think it could of been worse if Hilary won
Keep drinking the Kool-Aid you dumbasses
Never thought I would see a Presidental performance like this in my lifetime.
I don‚Äôt understand why pleople still excuses him They are so blind
"Your country is in big trouble and it‚Äôs not because of the leader, it‚Äôs because of a general dumbing down of the population."
"Based on Trump's behaviour and position taken with Putin, is that treason???"
"This president must go, protect the USA people, vote, vote, vote and hope that our votes are not corrupted."
"Anderson cooler go to hell.  You live on fake news. Shame, shame"
Trump should go home with Putin.
Just two old friends planning tonight's golden shower. I am pissed.
"Which side is he on? Throw the US Intelligence under the bus and praise Putin, are you kidding me!?!"
Looks more like he has something in Russian‚Äôs hand so he won‚Äôt stand up straight.
"Liberals, Progressives, Antifa, Moderates, Centrists. Put aside your differences, and unite against fascism. We are split in factions, arguing about the DNC and stuff. Thats over, Hillary lost. We need to unite against this current imminent danger. Stop allowing Trump to divide us against eachother. Thats the only way he can win. Not by consensus"
How can you even pretend to be smart. What a waste of talent.SAD

"A call to all true Republicans, we need to take our party back. We are the party that destroyed the Soviet Union not one that sides with communist."
Did you notice that he walked behind Putin
Yeah you seen all those years of all that puppeting work you guys did go right down to flames. LOL
"You may sayers want war.  This is a delegate moment.....geez, at least communication  is open and so is talk with investigators.  What would you have him do, go over there and start a world war????"
"Trump is smart and he knows what he is doing he is not bowing down and apologize for America, he is letting Putin know he is one that can't be bought."
Just goes to show Putin is running the American president!!
And here you have it. The first president to commit treason in American history
You want to complain and call treason and other negative remarks to get likes?  How about watching the interview and meeting between the two.  Read the official remarks (only on CSPAN) and after all of that then you have any reason to give comments or remarks on the meeting of the two countries.
Pee tapes and statutory rape would be my guess at what Putin has on dolt 45.
Clown News Network .. is a disgrace .. does not matter what Trump says or does .. haters going  to hate
GOOGLE WHATABOUTISM!!! SAYS IT ALL!!! WORTH IT!!! STRAIGHT TREASON!!!
"This is what u get Trump and putin go deep real deep and they want nothing more then to rule the world,but at what cost,I've said it from the beginning the movie Hunger games makes more sense everyday"
"Cooper , who cares what you think ?!?!?! Remember you are CNN , no ones pay attention to your network ."
CNN makes the Enquirer look credible
Hes a TRAITOR!!!!
He's saying this because Putin threw Hillary Clinton under the bus. He has nowhere else to go with his narrative now....Clintons colluded with the Russians....plain and simple
Hillary was right. Trump is Putin's puppet.
"CNN and all of their reporters can't be believed. All lies from the Clinton News Network, backed by Soros."
"And we all know that AC IS the CrapNoNews ""expert"" on 
ALL things! 
What a HOLE!! I mean JOKE!"
"President Trump said he had ""low expectations"" for this Putin summit, and so did I - but not this low!"
"Cooper is entitled to his opinion. 
Everyone is. 
No problem. 
Just stay civil and respectful toward one another."
"Let me add a new word to your vocabulary . Being DIPLOMATIC .It wouldn't help a thing if Trump jumped up and down yelling liar , liar pants on fire to Putin"
After the meeting Putin  has some Russians porno stars for trump to have fun that's  the real than you  trump to putin!!!!
"CNN are Professional in Only One Thing  ,Distorting the Truth Ì†ΩÌπÑ"
And yet there are those who will defend him Ì†ΩÌ∏°
What was so DISGRACEFUL about it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Never believed I would see this day when America was sold out to an enemy attacking us right now and our own President sold us out with Republicans!
I AGREE WITH ANDERSON COOPERÌ†ΩÌ≤Ø‚úî
And told Putin he'd have more flexibility after he's reelected. Impeach!
Of course you would say that Anderson!
"The truth of the matter is that before Putin met with Trump, he had all these demands - Putin wanted troops out of Syria, he wanted heavy weapons supplied by us out of Crimea, he wanted the Crimea annexation to be recognized, he wanted sanctions to be lifted.  Trump gave him none of those things.  He‚Äôs trying to broker peace but if he would have acted differently he would have been a warmonger.  Trump can‚Äôt win no matter what he says.  He knows Putin can‚Äôt be trusted but if you don‚Äôt have dialogue with him, what‚Äôs the alternative?  Status quo?  How is that making things better?"
CNN almost out of business
We always knew it but NOW THE WORLD knows that we are being led by a clown. BE PREPARED FOR ANYTHING
"We the silent majority, as well you know that there was no collusion between Trump and Russia. The media and democrats desperately trying to collage together a Frankenstein picture that there was. The root of all this is that HRC lost and they won‚Äôt accept it. Lack of accountability and matureness highly displayed by the democrats and liberal tyrant."
Even Brit Humme of the Fox Fake News Channel basically agrees!  LOL
CNN EQUAL TRASH NEWS ....Ì†æÌ¥óÌ†æÌ¥óÌ†æÌ¥óÌ†æÌ¥ó
"Putin inviting Mueller to Russia to continue his investigation ?  Are you serious ?  He will poison him  as soon as he gets off the plane.  My God, and pretty sure Trump would love that !"
"Be honest people. Did you really expect Anderson Cooper would say something positive about Trump? This is about as shocking as being told, the sky is blue!"
"""Helsinki""...yep, that sounds about right -- Where our country is headed with Trump at the helm:  HELL-SINKING! ...He's got 'U.S.' sinking to mother-loving HELL!"
Anderson Cooper is the product of white privilege..who cares what he says.
CNN - Clinton News Network  #FakeNews
He never can't win can't they see that he is making peace around the world
"A clear, brutal betrayal if ur country.  Impeach 45!"
"The snakes at CNN spitting venom against Trump and Putin when it was made clear again that there was no collusion nor Russian intervention in the elections. All these things were made up by the libtards/dems under the command of the illuminati banksters who are directing the deep state to work against Trump through their mouthpiece - the mainstream media. Corrupt and faithful to the deep state fbi and DOJ officials and journalists are mad that Trump met Putin. Instead of being happy that the two leaders met and could improve relations, they are utterly against it, servicing the illuminati bankster globalists whose ambitions to turn the whole world into their slaves has been delayed."
"Anderson Cooper, thank you"
HE SIDED WITH PUTIN OVER HIS OWN INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY.
Anderson Cooper is a douchbag
How do you bash your Allies and Your own country and kiss up to a Russian Leader. I am sure he is laughing at USA now!!
CNN needs a war. War brings ratings.
"it's irrelevant what Anderson Cooper thinks is or is not a disgrace. he's supposed to leave that sort of hot take to the pundits, otherwise stop passing himself off as a journalist, and just be a pundit."
Anderson Cooper is correct
CNN is a Disgraceful news Network
"This president will go down more treasonous than Nixon
What an absolute moronic thing to do in front of the world."
He's more caring and protective of Putin walking out than he was of the Queen.  TRAITOR to our country....TRAITOR to the FREE WORLD
Anderson Cooper for President 2020
"The (R) by all republican candidates and ""actors"" currently seated forever stands for Russian! Traitors!"
"Trump belittles the investigation of his own security agency and sides with Russia. 
Republicans: ‚ÄúITS OBAMA‚ÄôS FAULT. HILARY DID ____. OBAMA DIDN‚ÄôT _____. ‚Äú. If that doesn‚Äôt speak for itself ‚Äî I give up."
Anderson Cooper-thank you !
"Oh Good,That means Trump is vexing Marxists world wide"
Who listens to Anderson Cooper? I don‚Äôt.
"Lol, I‚Äôm sure... and I‚Äôm gonna believe him!!"
More fake news !!!that from someone who seen half his show taken from him for poor rating
I totally agree. It was treasonous.
This is treason
"Don't be brainwashed by CNN. You can not like Trump, and that is fine. But don't let CNN turn your dislike into Hostility.

That's how they win.

Hostility turns into violence, Violence turns into riots, and riots turns into ratings.

Ratings turn into money.

Polarizing the country is their goal."
Good ole CNN...
"Anderson Cooper is an intelligent man and an excellent reporter. He‚Äôs also from a wealthy NY family. I‚Äôll bet he is aware of Trump on many different levels. Personal, business and now whatever it is he is doing in the WH."
Trump sold America down the river today.
Fake News weighs in Ì†ΩÌ∏ÇÌ†ΩÌ∏ÇÌ†ΩÌ∏Ç
CNN   FAKE  NEWS
"Kind of like a 1939 summit, also involving Russia as memory serves."
He is 100 percent right
"CNN YOUR THE BIGGEST JOKE, IN THE U.S.A."
"When do charges of treason begin to be discussed, because trump sounds treasonous to me!"
Of course ANDERSON COOPER says that!
totally agree! Interesting to see how Fox spins this story
I wonder if people ever stop complaining.
"What more will it take? How can what was said today be considered preserving, protecting or defending the United States. This is not about Dems or Rep this is about our country. What is wrong with people?  Have you no pride anymore.  We were just kicked under the bus by the president. Do you want to live in a country like Russia? He embarrassed himself and this country.  How can anyone support a president like that?"
Putin‚Äôs puppet.
True. A. COOPER is braver than the President of the U.S.
What‚Äôs new show something good CNN has ever said about Trump.
Anderson Cooper is right!!!
Is clear we have TRAITOR in our Country and clearly works for the rusian president as a president of the united states!
Cooper is a dummy.   He better watch. Fox News. To find out how this is important one way or another !!!!
Trump is Putin's kissing buddy
ImpeachTrump.
Coming from CNN no big deal
"This is outrageous, so we are Allies with Russia now? Wtf?"
SEND THIS TRAITOR TO JAIL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
...but he got a beautiful soccer ball ... briliant .... USA ... USA ... USA ...
"CNN and the mainstream media outrage machine is trusted less than a geopolitical rival. What does that say about your terrible bias and unwillingness to uphold journalistic integrity. I don't think anyone is surprised that ya'll are ""astonished"". Also - Anderson Cooper and Fruitcake Acosta are amazing drama queens."
"But we never examined the DNC server , just take our word for it , yet no Dramacrat has ever denied the truth of the leaks , only outrage that they were outed , run don‚Äôt walk only the lame remain"
its Trumps way to put the blame back on the American protection and others . why should he take the fall for it when he wants to look good for the elections coming up
Anderson Cooper is disgraceful
Cooper you‚Äôre the one it‚Äôs a disgrace how can you say that after Obama with his apology tour for eight years he was the one that was a disgrace
"Hank you, Anderson Cooper!"
CNN is fake news...right?
"If he‚Äôs disgusted, it doesn‚Äôt matter. Has he ever been pleased? NO. Will he ever be pleased? NO.  Mr Trump made the effort. You have no idea what he said behind closed doors. 
Trump could walk across the Hudson and Cooper would faux investigate how come Trump never learned to swim!"
Let‚Äôs see. Anderson Cooper and CNN are salty?? Ì†ΩÌ∏Ç. That‚Äôs new(s)
What does one expect from a fraud  who has many negative adjectives that completely describes him!
Anderson Cooper is an embarrassment!!
"CNN:  ""He blinked.""   OMG OMG OMG..."
CNN SUCKS and so does Anderson Cooper.
Right on Anderson Cooper!
More CNN propaganda !!!
"Did you see
Paul Ryan‚Äôs and other republican responses ?? That meeting was a Embarrassment to the USA !!"
Fak Anderson Cooper.
Trump's Putin's puppet.
CNN is garbage Ì†ΩÌ∏í all lies
I think our government needs to be overthrown and leave that guy in Russia. Freeze all his accounts. Kick the Russian diplomats back out. Seize his properties. Turn them into homeless shelters an adult Rehabilitation job placement centers. Sell off his properties to rebuild the infrastructure. Knock his name off those buildings.
Make Russia great again!?
Can‚Äôt stand Anderson Cooper or CNN....
CNN- Clinton News Network.
Luv Anderson Cooper and i agree with you.
"CNN, subtitle please"
"Who‚Äôs Melania going home with , Putin or Donald?"
Anderson Cooper you're an idiot
"MAGA MAGA, salute Ì†ΩÌ±ã to the Lord Donald Trump who successfully put the last nail on the USA‚Äôs death coffin. MAGA MAGA. Long Life to our Lord Donald Trump. MAGA MAGA. Gnam gnam MAGA MAGA."
They still have David Gergen on the show? He‚Äôs the one they filmed running around naked at Bohemian Grove lol
You mean Obama's hot mic where he said he would be more flexible to Russia wasn't disgraceful
Anderson Cooper works at CNN which is the utmost disgraceful media outlet in the world and he is one of the reasons.
Liberal news cnn

Try just telling the News! That would be refreshing!
But it will never happen, because you all are too far gone!"
Of course you do you have nothing positive to say of all the great things that president trump has done
Trash cnn

Fake news CNN
CNN  best news
They really need a ignorant emoji
We need people in the street 3% of the population united en masse against this administration. He is following Putin's lead. He is using Putin as a role model. Putin kills journalists and his political opponents. They will allow interference and assist each other in getting elected and as they kept repeating they together own 90% of the worlds nuclear power. The mid terms are not going to fix or change anything now. United no other gov can stop them. The only thing that can stop them now is WE the People.
Cnn. Gone crazy.
"I am running an open pole now, which is more entertaining, liberal conspiracy theories, or the public meltdowns... so far it‚Äôs a toss up.."
"would not matter with the media, they edit clips they want you to see, put their own spin on everything and 90% who listent to these guys think they speak 100% truth"
"Anderson Cooper, lol."
Disgraceful? Treason? did I miss something??
"Did you ever watch Obama, LOL. Anderson, you‚Äôre a disgrace as a journalist. From now on I will change the channel when you talk or turn the TV off. You are an absolute Hypocrite"
"Mueller has proven zeo collusion. Socialist, Anderson Cooper hasnt improved upon that."
"hey Anderson, I liked you and I believe you, don't worry about the idiot #45, his supporters are too blinds and deaf for knowing nothing about him"
CNN is a joke!
FOCK CNN
Make Russia great again?
"If you put all the pieces together here's what you get. The DNC rigs the Democratic Primary Election against Bernie Sanders so Hilliary can win the nomination. Obama's administration starts to request surveillance on Trump, his family, his transition team, and anyone associated with him. Donna Brazil gives Hilliary the questions to a debate. The DNC pays Christopher Steele to come up with a smear dossier about Trump. The mainstream media releases a taped conversation about Trump talking about grabbing women parts. After all this Trump still wins the General Election. Obama orders an investigation into Russia meddling in our elections. Obama changes Executive Order 12333 to allow more agencies to have access to surveillance data. The Democratic Party comes up with a scandal that Trump Colluded with Russia to win the election with no evidence or proof. This wild claim is backed up by the mainstream media. Obama hold overs start unmasking Trump's transition team and staff members then release the classified information to the mainstream media. Why? Because the DNC and the Obama administration colluded with the intelligence community to thwart Trump's campaign efforts to get him elected president. All this Russia collusion is an attempt to cover up the fact that the Obama administration, the intelligence community, the DNC, along with the mainstream media used our nations surveillance as a political tool to try to get Hilliary elected President. This makes Watergate look like a kindergarten play. Let that sink in......."
When will this government wake up who knows what‚Äôs puto got on him!
CNN. Delete
Oh boy this guy/girl is real fake news.
Treason
President Trump called out Crooked Hillary and Snowflake Cooper is about to cry.
"Yes, there is a traitor in our White House. Ì†ΩÌ≤î"
"Great job, President Trump!"
Well Anderson Cooper is biased. F him.
How is this a shock to ANYONE???
Embarrassed and hurting over this person who says he is our president

I can't stand a thing Mr. Cooper says.
"CNN SUCKS!
ANDERSON COOPER SWALLOWS!"
TRUMP:  you're not welcome back in the USA
Traitor.
"I agree totally, mr. Cooper"
"Walter Cronkite only judged once and it was on Vietnam,  other times he reported the news, didn't biased it in any way"
Where have you been Andersen? He's been doing this all along.
"Putin is Still attacking the United States of America, Trump just gave comfort & aid to our #1 enemy he commited Treason in front of the world. #TrumpIsATraitor #TreasonSummit #IMPEACHTrump

SHAME!! He‚Äôs a disgrace!!
"Fox Business is saying the exact same thing.  Wow, the CNN and Fox actually agree."
We know who‚Äôs side he‚Äôs on.
That is because you Anderson Cooper are bias to everything that Trump has to say! All of your news is to obstruct Trump from ever getting ahead. I never listen to anything they have to say after seeing their transparent bias.
Trump in Helsinki was getting his mid-year performance review from Putin. He may have stumbled on few words with the media in front of his boss.
"Why would trump entertain this meeting to happen ? Lol 

His wife must truly support him or embarrassed!?"
Anderson Cooper would have issues if Trump said the sky was blue.
"It horrifies me that McConnell,  Gowdy, Ryan , Pence , or even Kelly are silent......Absolutely horrified"
"Very, very well done President Donald J. Trump; keep #MAGA. Thank you for your bravery. The Dems propaganda must be stopped. We were able to make Germany, Italy, and Japan from terrible foes to allies; we can do the same with Russia. Thank you President Donald J. Trump for your courage to fix the international mess created by Obama and crooked Hillary."
Anderson who?
Agreed! U republicians really need to stop and listen wht Trump said! If Obama did tht u would want his butt! Come on! Enough is enough! Backing Russia over are own intelligent agencys? Thats treasonous it is!
Anderson Cooper kisses men end of story
"The contrast between the replies on CNN's Facebook and Fox News' Facebook.  

Rip bipartisanship"
trump is a disaster
War is coming.
Anderson....You're spot on!
he also said they could not fine the server and that was also true with the emails they are leaving out some of the words he spoke The President know's what he is doing that is why he is there and these new's people are where they are.

"The trolls and idiots are taking over every feed.

Can‚Äôt wait to see/read how  his ‚Äú base‚Äù will react to all this. And also his propaganda media machine. And his  Press Secretary.  Get ready for some of the most disgracefully bizarre performances ever witnessed in this country. May somehow those who voted to put this cancerous regime into power start to awaken to the reality of ‚Äú The Republican Way.‚Äù May this be the start of the downfall of the world- view of the corporate masters. Remember: ‚Äú The Internationale unites the world in song.‚Äù
He's going down folks!!!!
"Anderson‚Äôs pooper would have spewed out s*** regardless what trump said, if he seemed weak he woulda said it like he did, if he came out strong he would of accused him of trying to start ww3 , it doesn‚Äôt matter what happens , they are going to go against it, it‚Äôs their entire platform now that they have nothing left"

Cooper is a dimwit and all the liberal stations are putting their own spin on how to take Trumps talk and twist it to their own devices Yes he was not tough enough but it was really his first time on such a huge international stage He made mistakes that I‚Äôm sure he regrets but he is far from a traitor Amazing commentary
Cooper is an A**hat controlled by the deepstate
Must‚Äôve been a rousing success then!!

"Well as I looked at the CNN page a few minutes ago for a moment I thought boy am I going to brag. I can predict the future. But no it was just too easy any of us could have done it. Even you few viewers left with CNN could have written it. Here is what I put on the page about 24 hours ago.  "" For all of you CNN fans that are left I thought it would be nice if I go ahead and give your CNN News excuse me FAKE news of Trump's meeting with Putin now instead of having to wait. They may be coming up with a new phrase anyway like CNN Breaking News ""We give you our news FAST before it actually happens. So here you are. Now you can beat your friends getting on facebook with it !! Trump/Putin meeting was a complete disaster for the World. Trump looked awful. They whispered to each other like Obama did ! Trump went ahead and gave them all the rest of the Uranium that Hillary forgot. Trump told them to go ahead and keep Crimea and you can have Poland and Germany too ! Trump is going to go ahead and buy Natural Gas from Russian even though Texas has enough to last for centuries. Oh and he asked Putin if the over 62 million voters that showed up for him really even need to vote next time or will Putin take care of it like CNN says he did. CNN because faster and completely biased is more important than being wrong !  Our President met with the leader of the second most powerful nation on earth and had frank hopefully fruitful discussions to maybe improve the world and this is what we get from the fake news of our own country. The problem you liberal snowflakes have with we conservatives is that we do not forget. Remember during the Obama Romney debates when Romney called Russia America's most powerful and dangerous adversary. Obama and you followers laughed all night long and the next day. Why are you not laughing now."
